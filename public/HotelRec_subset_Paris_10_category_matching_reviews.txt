      "title": "Wow -- Epitomy of a Five Star Hotel",
      "text": "My family just completed a five night stay at the Mandarin Oriental (MO) and what an incredible experience. For some background, we always book through AMEX FHR and since we travel with kids we normally book a junior suite at a hotel with a connecting room for the kids. When I think about an outstanding hotel, there are three components that must all come together for a truly five star experience. The physical property - hotel, location and service. For our stay, the MO hit five stars on each one. The hotel is about a year old and fundamentally different from other five star hotels in Paris -- it is not stuffy or pretentious. It is chic and modern with a good amount of technology in the rooms to help you control lights, television, and steam room in your shower. The room was extremely comfortable and we overlooked the inner garden. Our suite had an i-Pad that controlled the B&O flat screen TV and sound system. Our beds were among the best we have stayed in to include Four Season, Shangri-La and Ritz properties. The bath areas for both the suite and bedroom for the kids was spacious with two separate sinks and a walk-in rain shower. The public areas were intimate with lots of private areas for parties to meet and hold conversations. The spa, pool and fitness areas were top notch. Finally, the inner garden court was the perfect venue for morning breakfast and evening drinks. As for location, the hotel is located on Rue St Honore which is the equivalent of Rodeo Drive in the U.S. and then some You are five minutes walking distance from Place Vendome, ten minutes from Place Concordia, 15 minutes from the Louvre, and about 25 minutes from Notre Dame. Given the challenge to sometimes find a taxi and the traffic in Paris, being able to walk to most places was beneficial for my family. Bottom line, the hotel is located in a great location. Finally, the service. When we arrived we were greeted by the hotel manager who offered us a glass of champagne while we checked-in. We were then escorted to our rooms. Upon arrival in the rooms there were treats for the children -- this is a small thing but it helps to make a great impression on the kids that they are appreciated at the hotel. Speaking of kids, the hotel does a great job of catering to children and ensuring that they are treated as highly valued guests. Throughout our entire stay, all hotel staff did an incredible job of making us feel genuinely welcome. They were warm, friendly and engaging. The atmosphere is professional but relaxed and definitely not stuffy. I also need to recognize the concierge staff -- they are great. Adrienne and Jonathan are stars and everyday engaged with my family on activities and great dinner recommendations. In closing, our stay at the MO was a real treat with a lot of great memories of a wonderful stay in Paris enhanced by the staff at a world-class hotel.",

      "title": "So Disappointing - The Service Does Not Match The Price",
      "text": "I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Paris for 3 nights in September and selected the hotel based on the location and glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately, I experienced a number of service hiccups that I have never encountered at other hotels in Paris and beyond, and am very disappointed with the overall experience. Upon arrival, the street was blocked off because of royal guests who were staying at the Mandarin so I had to lug my suitcases by myself from the intersection (wondering why a hotel bellboy wasn\u2019t stationed to help arriving guests, as there was no way to access the hotel entrance.) I arrived 30 minutes before official check-in time and despite requesting early check-in, I had to wait for my room which was not a problem as I was offered water and had an espresso in the courtyard bar. My room was a Deluxe King facing the courtyard. It was beautifully decorated and very quiet. It could have been improved with a full-length mirror (absent from the room which is unusual nowadays) and better lighting, but it was very comfortable and I slept perfectly each night. No hallway noise or adjacent room noise or courtyard noise. I also enjoyed the location with easy access to all of the luxury shopping boutiques, and the peaceful courtyard was a perfect place to unwind after long days of shopping. The breakfast was also fantastic. Super friendly and lovely staff in both the bar and the Camelia restaurant. However, I found the concierge and front desk service to be extremely disappointing. On my first day, I asked a hotel employee at the concierge desk to call a certain boutique I wished to visit on the Left Bank to confirm they were open. He dismissed me saying of course they are open. I politely insisted that he nevertheless call, and he again refused saying he knew for a fact they were open because the store just delivered some packages to another hotel guest. I could not convince him to pick up the phone (and my phone did not have global roaming) so I waited 30 minutes for a taxi, then spent 45 minutes in rush hour traffic -- plus over 40 Euros in round-trip taxi fare -- to discover the store had closed one hour early for a private event. I was livid! When I returned to the hotel and informed the manager that the concierge refused to call and the store was indeed closed (therefore wasting my time and money), there was no real response, no apology, no recompensation for the time/money I wasted due to the rudeness/laziness of a hotel employee. I also made a spa appointment through the front desk upon arrival and was handed a print-out with the details of my service, including the price. When I called the spa to inquire about another service, I was informed that the actual cost of my booked treatment was 30 Euros more than the print-out said. I stated that I expected the spa to honor the price on the print-out handed to me by the hotel front desk, and was told that would not be possible. I ended up changing my treatment entirely (the spa service was very lovely with the private treatment suites but I expect any errors on behalf of the hotel front desk to be corrected without penalizing the guest!) Finally, on my last night prior to departure, I asked the concierge to arrange a taxi return to the airport and was assured they would do so. The morning of my departure, I stopped by the front desk to confirm the taxi and was told that I was not on the list! Luckily, they were able to arrange one for me with 15 minutes notice but I was quite unsettled that something as important as airport transfer could somehow get lost in the wind. I have never experienced any one of these issues at any other Mandarin or other luxury hotel property at which I have stayed around the world. And I think this is probably the most expensive room charge I have ever paid (at any Mandarin or other luxury hotel). The service absolutely does not match the expectations I had of a Mandarin, and certainly not the price charged. For the prices they charge, the concierge should -- at the very least -- make a phone call when asked by a hotel guest!!! I also completed a hotel survey to inform hotel management of these issues, hoping they would at least apologize or attempt to resolve prior to filling out a negative Trip Advisor review but I never heard back from the hotel.",

      "text": "The Mandarin Oriental Paris is the latest additional to the expanding portfolio of hotels by the Mandarin Oriental Group, a luxury chain that originates in Asia and now finding a strong footing in Europe. I have debated myself if I should book the more renowned Four Seasons George V with classical luxury or the brand new and way more contemporary Mandarin Oriental. In the end, the newness and more modern rooms of the Mandarin Oriental Paris swayed my decision. I also booked this hotel under the Virtuoso program. Even under this program, the rates are phenomenally expensive, but then this is Paris where everything under the Sun is expensive in this city. Arriving I arrived after checking out from the Renaissance. The hotel is located at the Rue St Horne, a supposedly upscale parisan location. The entrance to the hotel is surprising small, and it is easy to miss. Again this has to do with the fact that real estate prices in Paris are very expensive so most hotels will be of the small size variety, especially newer ones. I arrived early but my room was ready for me. Among the benefits of the Virtuoso program are free breakfast, a welcome amenity ( usually just simple fruit plate or tidbits ), a spa voucher and an upgrade to the next room category. The hotel wasn\u2019t able to upgrade me because they claim they are having full occupancy but I managed to exchange the Spa voucher with free internet which is much more useful. My check-in was handled by a very nice and friendly lady by the name of Pauline and she was gracious enough to show me the hotel restaurants and facilities before escorting me to the room. Upon entering the room, she also took the time to introduce me to the room facilities and explain how to get things to work. I requested a Blu-Ray player and she arranged a PS3 instead which is just as good since I wanted to watch some movies I bought in London. All in all, a great check-in experience. I speculated that Ms Pauline isn't French since she smiles a lot and was very friendly, something most Parisans aren\u2019t. :) The Room I booked a Mandarin Room, the largest room type in the Mandarin Oriental Paris. The room measures 50sqm and will easily qualify as a junior suite in other hotels. Most hotel rooms in Paris are small so the space is a real luxury. Glancing around the room, the d\u00e9cor is of the Art-Deco contemporary style with top notch furnishing. There is a very cool 40\u201d Bang & Olufsen TV, which rotates out from the cabinet when you switch it on and rotates back when it is switched off. The in-house entertainment system from the hotel provides TV channels, high definition programs and even games and other services. Unfortunately, the TV software failed to work many times, apparently due to \u201csystem error\u201d. There are abundant A/V connections and plugs on the work desk. There\u2019s no walk in closet but the wardrobe have amble spaces. The spacious bathroom is decorated in subdue white, very soothing and relaxing. It\u2019s a full ensuite with dual sinks, rainforest shower and a deep sinking tub with Ad Nortam TV built into the wall mirror. The water pressure is adequate and the bathroom fittings I think are the high end Axor Hansgrohe. The bathrobes are very large and fluffy. One thing I think one has to be careful about this bathroom is that the bathtub is very slippery. Also, as the designer is going for style over practicality, there are many sharp edges in the bathroom from accessories protruding out from the wall. This might pose a hazard to some. The bed is really the best part of the room, with soft silky linens and a very comfortable mattress with just the right amount of firmness, not too hard and not too soft. There are several settings for mood lighting but I thought the switches were kind of difficult to use. Wireless internet is provided which is very fast. Finally, there\u2019s also free mineral water ( Viola! ) and Nepresso coffee machine. One last thing, the room is truly whisper quiet, evident of first class sound proofing. Mine was a corner room and it is so quiet that I can even hear a pin drop literally. The downside for asking a quiet corner room is that there are no views at all. Rooms that feature terrace might be noisier since the terrace gardens are very popular with outside guests. Location and Common Areas The hotel is located in the upscale Rue St Honore with designer shops and boutiques just next door to the hotel. The famous Lourve museum is also a short walking distance from the hotel. The hotel is small so there isn\u2019t much places to explore. The hotel has a Bar and a Caf\u00e9 restaurant and both share the terrace garden. There is also a fine dining restaurant by the famed Chef Thiery Marx but it was closed during my stay so I couldn\u2019t try out. I end up dining at the excellent Le Cinq at the Four Seasons instead. The common areas are nicely decorated but doesn\u2019t really wow me like when I enter the Four Seasons. The Spa and fitness centre were located at the basement. The gym is well equipped but very small. Service Services at the Mandarin Oriental Paris are on an overall basis inconsistent, more of a hit and miss senario. Some are very good and unfortunately, some are rather bad. Overall, it\u2019s still rather rough around the edges, which is quite normal for a newly opened hotel. I will just list them down so you have a better idea. Let\u2019s get the negatives out of the way first shall we? Here\u2019s the long list : 1) Breakfast at the Camelia is really poor. The food served to me was bland and the pasteries and bread tasteless. I was expecting better food quality. The service was also very slow. It took them 15mins before my bread basket even arrived, and that is after I have alerted the Manager on duty. The Manager seems to be doing most of the serving while the staff just go slow and seems can\u2019t be bothered. It\u2019s a good thing that breakfast is included because no way I will pay 50 euros for this kind of food. 2) Most of the staff don\u2019t really follow up. For example, I asked housekeeping for some stickers for my luggage box, she said will check but didn\u2019t get back to me. I asked reception to put a dental kit in my room. That was forgotten as well. Also, I complained to Front Desk that the English Tv channels such as BBC were not working, she suggested that I can watch the French channels instead. 3) There\u2019s some re-curing software problem with the TV and a lot of programs are not able to be screened. The hotel attempt at service recovery by giving me a complimentary bottle of wine and some fruits but this problem repeat again the second night. 4) I asked the concierge to wrap a bottle of wine I purchased for check-in. Due to a change of shift, it was forgotten until I call to chase. 5) A Housekeeping staff entered my room when I have the Do Not Disturb sign on. He claims dubiously that he thought I have forgotten to turn it off. Well, in that case, what\u2019s the point of having a DND function in the room? 6) I asked for additional bath towels and the service attendant that brought it to me was rather unhappy because he bought the wrong ones and was asked to come again. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy looking a sour faces when I am staying in a luxury hotel. 7) The gym equipment was not regularly clean. All of them feel kind of \u201csticky\u201d. I didn\u2019t see any staff in the gym. It was empty. 8) The room service menu selection is mundane and boring, featuring such \u201cimaginative\u201d selections as hamburger and Indonesia fried rice. Ordered In-room dinning for breakfast as I am departing airport early.The food quality is just passable. Certainly not all is bad. There are some aspect of the hotel service that deserved praises too. 1) Competent Concierge staff, including arranging my transport needs and get a staff to escort me on an errant. One of the concierge staff in particular, Mr Jonathan stands out as being the most friendly and helpful of the lot. Every thing I asked to him were answered by \"not a problem at all!\" , \"Absolutely we can help!\", and \"My pleasure!\" . It's so refreshing to find a hotel staff that actually loves his job and show such enthusiasm. 2) Good check-in and welcome experience from Ms Pauline as described above. 3) The hotel staff learned that I was pick pocketed and lost my wallet along with cash and credit cards, much to my aggravation. The Manager on duty actually called and volunteer to help. Well, there\u2019s nothing much useful he can really do to be honest but I do appreciate the show of concern. 4) Attempt at service recovery after the TV didn\u2019t work with a free bottle of wine and fruits ( well, the TV still didn\u2019t work but at least they try\u2026 ) 5) I was on my way to a lunch appointment and found out that the pockets of my newly purchased jacket was still sealed. I called the in-house tailor and she was nice ( and competent ) enough to get it done in under 5 mins and rush it back to me on time. Now that\u2019s service! 6) Book a hotel limo car and the driver was kind enough not only to escort me into the airport but also going out of the way to help with luggage and tax refund. Now that\u2019s service! Conclusion It\u2019s quite clear judging from the room rates it charges that the Mandarin Oriental Paris attempt to position itself as a top-end luxury hotel in Paris. In the end, the results are decidedly mixed. The room is definitely gorgeous and well equipped and I love the bed. However, the service is not measuring up overall. While there are some outstanding individuals, there are too many cases whereby I need to call to chase. Some of the junior staff especially from housekeeping is not well trained and one can tell they are very uncomfortable when interacting with guests. Perhaps after a year or so, this hotel will measure up but as at now, I will only rate it a 4/5. It\u2019s a very expensive hotel and it needs to deliver to ensure guests feels they are getting value for money. Just having a nice room is insufficient. Areas that the hotel need to improve especially are the services and the F&B quality. The hotel needs to improve the training of the staff to be more service conscious and prepare to go the extra mile when called for. They should remember that they work for one of the finest luxury hotel chains in the world. So will I come back? Hard to say but if I ever will to come back to Paris, which is not a certain considering the crime rate and what I have gone through, I am likely to try the Four Seasons George V instead.",

      "text": "Stay for 3 nights for travel last week, here is my experience. The hotel is located in the very central of shopping district , really close to get anywhere you would like to go. All the equipment are top-notch, included Josephine Home,Diptyque amenities, bathrobes by Frette, Bang & Olufsen audio system , even mariage freres teapot. In general , the members were always smile and helpful. I also expected what we called seamless service in mandarin oriental hotel, which really touch me in Hongkong and Bangkok. But some points may not equal to its top price in paris 1. After I was check-in, my luggage was not delivered to my room for more than 1 hour until I informed the front desk. 2. Teapot!! It never happen to me like that. I like to have tea in room and I also have a mariage freres teapot. This time, when I filled up hot water and pour out the tea. But there were oily and milky-like material floating on the tea. When I look inside the pot , so MANY DIRTIES on the wall of teapot. Although I do not check it first, i wonder it is the problem due to the way of its washing , or the quality of water (evian?) or they do not clean it thoroughly? And the housekeeping man just came over and exchanged one for me. No sorry eventually. 3. Stop calling me! At 3pm , I told to the first house-keeping man that please clean my room at 6pm. Then, 15mins later Another one call me and asked which time I prefer to clean my room. I responsed her politely. Oh-lala, 20min later, another one ring my door and ask if I would like to clean room NOW? I do not know if I was spoiled by asia enthusiasm like bangkok. The hotel is really amaizing in europe I think. But I expected it more!! BTW, the spa and thebreakfast are excellant! My recommendation: choose package and try spa",

      "text": "This is my 5th time staying in the MO Paris. Always enjoy the check in procedure, with a glass of complimentary champagne and the receptionist will greet you wherever you fancy sitting in the lobby area. Been around the world I still have not experienced another hotel doing this (apart from the Aman resort). Flower arrangement is always lively and smart. The garden area plants are maturing very nicely compare to when it was first opened 6 years ago. Got upgraded to a suite this time and the suite is superb with a living room area equipped with a B&O TV and HiFi system. (There's another 60\" B&O TV on the wall in the bedroom). Beautifully appointed bathroom with a very large shower room and double sinks as well as a stand alone bathtub (with another TV fitted on the bathroom wall). I particularly like love the Dipyque shower gel and shampoo MO Paris provided. You also have a comprehensive pillow menu to choose your preferred pillow. My friend took a rose petal pillow and I opted for a memory foam pillow as usual. The king size bed is so comfortable and although we were facing the Main Street above the hotel entrance. It was so quiet and nice to be able to see the outside world from the 5Th floor. I drove to the hotel this time and I didn't have to worry a thing for the porter took care of my car and luggages were delivered to my room before my check in procedure was done. We ordered breakfast in the room two mornings in a row. Very good room service menu choice and always delivered on time with my FT newspaper. Have been to many luxury hotels in Paris. I still think MO Paris has the best service and the largest room size in Paris. Location is excellent too. Two minutes from Palace Vendom and the same road of the hotel is perfect for high end fashion shopping with almost every top luxury brands. I particularly never miss a stroll to the Orangery for Monet's paintings after breakfast to relax my mind and soul. I am a fan and always will be. Allen",

      "text": "After much debate, we decided to stay for five nights at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris. The location can't be beat- right on the Rue Saint-Honore, yet still close to the Seine, Left Bank, Tuileries, and Louvre. We initially thought about the less stuffy Left Bank, but the room sizes and questionable plumbing and service quality kept us away. At the Mandarin, the regular rooms are very roomy by Paris standards, and the Junior Suite also quite comfortable. The hotel is only a few years old, so the plumbing and electricity work wonderfully. The junior suite comes with a washlet toilet, a great luxury in Paris. The amenities can't be beat- wonderful toiletries, bath oil with a cute dropper, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, the list goes on. The Four Seasons in several other European cities have much inferior toiletries and slippers than the Mandarin. The rooms are very stylized, with lush interior fabrics. Unfortunately, we arrived on a day when the street was blocked by a crane transporting building materials for a roof terrace that the Mandarin is building, so we had to get out and walk almost a block. The entry to the hotel is very discreet- just a tiny black opening on the row of storefronts. No separate driveway in front. The doormen took care of our luggage transport, but we were underwhelmed by the tiny lobby and lack of much comfortable seating. The lobby felt more like a bus station than the lobby of a nice hotel. Luckily, the rooms were much, much better. Our rooms faced the interior courtyard, which was quiet and rather pretty. The hotel restaurant, Camellia, is located in the courtyard and there is lush plantings and sculptures there. We ate at the Camellia twice. Both times, while the cold buffet was of very high quality, the service was not. We had to wait over fifteen minutes to hail a server for drinks both times. The server did not tell us that you can order hot entrees as part of the buffet price; the maitre'd finally told us. Silverware was dropped on us by the waitstaff. Large bottles of water that we ordered came without enough glasses for all four of us, so we had to try to hail the server again for an extra one. We ordered room service for breakfast thereafter. Much faster and a very large selection, including Japanese and Chinese breakfasts. Only a few goofs on the room service orders, perhaps because the room service staff was not too clear on what accompanied a Japanese or a Chinese breakfast. The driver and Eiffel Tower guide were wonderful. We had the same driver throughout our stay and he could not have been more accommodating and helpful. The Eiffel Tower guide arrive about fifteen minutes late, but he was energetic and knowledgeable. The guide for the Louvre was a bit moribund and the delivery a bit boring, but she knew the paintings pretty well. She did skip some important paintings at the Musee D'Orsay, but spoke about them when redirected to them. The service was very friendly and professional at the Mandarin, much more friendly than at most Parisian hotels. The concierge was helpful in booking cars, tours, guides, and numerous restaurant reservations. The hotel infrastructure (plumbing, elevators, lighting) was much better than at most Mandarin Oriental hotels. The wifi is free, which always makes me happy (it is a pet peeve when a very expensive hotel charges extra for the internet, as the internet is a must in today's age). The location cannot be beat for food, sights, shopping. One of our suitcases was delayed by the airline, and we were able to get replacement dressy mens' items in about a three block radius of the hotel very quickly. The Armani across the street was able to tailor a jacket within two hours. Excellent choice for a friendly, non-stuffy, cosmopolitan hotel with state of the art plumbing, decor, and amenities in a prime location in Paris. While the hotel may lack some of the history and grandness of the other well known hotels in Paris, it is a very comfortable and quiet place to stay. More of a pied-a-terre feel and that staff makes you feel right at home.",

      "title": "So Disappointing - The Service Does Not Match The Price",
      "text": "I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Paris for 3 nights in September and selected the hotel based on the location and glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately, I experienced a number of service hiccups that I have never encountered at other hotels in Paris and beyond, and am very disappointed with the overall experience. Upon arrival, the street was blocked off because of royal guests who were staying at the Mandarin so I had to lug my suitcases by myself from the intersection (wondering why a hotel bellboy wasn\u2019t stationed to help arriving guests, as there was no way to access the hotel entrance.) I arrived 30 minutes before official check-in time and despite requesting early check-in, I had to wait for my room which was not a problem as I was offered water and had an espresso in the courtyard bar. My room was a Deluxe King facing the courtyard. It was beautifully decorated and very quiet. It could have been improved with a full-length mirror (absent from the room which is unusual nowadays) and better lighting, but it was very comfortable and I slept perfectly each night. No hallway noise or adjacent room noise or courtyard noise. I also enjoyed the location with easy access to all of the luxury shopping boutiques, and the peaceful courtyard was a perfect place to unwind after long days of shopping. The breakfast was also fantastic. Super friendly and lovely staff in both the bar and the Camelia restaurant. However, I found the concierge and front desk service to be extremely disappointing. On my first day, I asked a hotel employee at the concierge desk to call a certain boutique I wished to visit on the Left Bank to confirm they were open. He dismissed me saying of course they are open. I politely insisted that he nevertheless call, and he again refused saying he knew for a fact they were open because the store just delivered some packages to another hotel guest. I could not convince him to pick up the phone (and my phone did not have global roaming) so I waited 30 minutes for a taxi, then spent 45 minutes in rush hour traffic -- plus over 40 Euros in round-trip taxi fare -- to discover the store had closed one hour early for a private event. I was livid! When I returned to the hotel and informed the manager that the concierge refused to call and the store was indeed closed (therefore wasting my time and money), there was no real response, no apology, no recompensation for the time/money I wasted due to the rudeness/laziness of a hotel employee. I also made a spa appointment through the front desk upon arrival and was handed a print-out with the details of my service, including the price. When I called the spa to inquire about another service, I was informed that the actual cost of my booked treatment was 30 Euros more than the print-out said. I stated that I expected the spa to honor the price on the print-out handed to me by the hotel front desk, and was told that would not be possible. I ended up changing my treatment entirely (the spa service was very lovely with the private treatment suites but I expect any errors on behalf of the hotel front desk to be corrected without penalizing the guest!) Finally, on my last night prior to departure, I asked the concierge to arrange a taxi return to the airport and was assured they would do so. The morning of my departure, I stopped by the front desk to confirm the taxi and was told that I was not on the list! Luckily, they were able to arrange one for me with 15 minutes notice but I was quite unsettled that something as important as airport transfer could somehow get lost in the wind. I have never experienced any one of these issues at any other Mandarin or other luxury hotel property at which I have stayed around the world. And I think this is probably the most expensive room charge I have ever paid (at any Mandarin or other luxury hotel). The service absolutely does not match the expectations I had of a Mandarin, and certainly not the price charged. For the prices they charge, the concierge should -- at the very least -- make a phone call when asked by a hotel guest!!! I also completed a hotel survey to inform hotel management of these issues, hoping they would at least apologize or attempt to resolve prior to filling out a negative Trip Advisor review but I never heard back from the hotel.",

      "text": "Grand Hotel Francais Fantastic hotel - would definitely recommend to others and would stay here again. Loved the boutique hotel decor, location, breakfast, thoughtfully provided amenities and friendly staff. These guys have really thought of everything. Really enjoyed our stay here. Service Great service from Zyad the manager and the young lady with long blonde hair (Sorry i never asked her name) - very welcoming and accommodating, giving us maps and directions and being very responsive to any other needs (eg I needed to print out something, so the manager gave me a usb drive to put it on for printing on the hotel pc). Both were fluent in english and even tried helping me with my really bad french. It was our first trip to Paris and I had asked for a quiet room as well - not sure which helped, but we got upgraded to a superior room with a bathtub. Check-in and check-out were very quick and efficient. Room servicing was efficient and thorough - everything was always well done and bathroom always sparkling clean. The maids did seem to want to enter the room a couple of times after it had been cleaned - a bit strange, not sure why though as my french is pretty poor. Room We were in room 16 which is just up the stairs at the back of the hotel, overlooks a side street with view of the park. Decor was a nice change from all the floral bedspreads seen on nearly every other hotel in the same price range - contemporary decor (new) and a small but well-laid out room. Amenities included aircon, free wifi from room (with daily code from reception), fridge, phone, lcd tv, in-room safe (english channels were BBC and CNN). The aircon and welcome bottle of chilled water in the fridge were a huge plus for my partner after we lugged our bags from Nation station (it was at the end of summer). Room was a superior one with a bathroom - not sure if this makes the room bigger than a standard, but size was decent, didn't feel really cramped as was expecting for Paris (although there really is only space for one suitcase to be laid out). Lighting provided was a big plus for me as many hotels often have only lamps by the bed making reading difficult - but there was good overall room lighting, over the bed lighting (each side) as well as a lamp and wall lighting - lots of options. Also really liked the clever use of storage space and shelving, given the size of the room. Bed was a queen, extremely comfortable with crisp white sheets and a euro and standard pillow to choose from. Food isn't allowed in the room and there are no tea/coffee making facilities - I came prepared and brought my own kettle and teabags as I can't get by without my cuppa in the afternoon - hope that was ok, didn't get any comments on it. A fridge is provided, and you can optionally have it stocked by the hotel or use it to chill your own water or wine (1.5 l bottle of water is 70 centimes across the road at the supermarket). Everything was pretty new and all in perfect working order. Overall the room was great. The only problem we had was occasional noise from the next door north american guests (sorry, but we could hear their conversations and accents) who would sometimes have very loud and vocal discussions at strange hours of the night. Not the hotel's fault, just inconsiderate travellers (different lots of guests too). It wasn't annoying enough to call reception, but it did wake us up a couple of times. Bathroom Bathroom was lovely and sparklingly shiny and clean, although on the small side (as to be expected in Paris). All the standard amenities were available, and even slippers were provided. We had a bathtub room with shower. Watch out for the tiny gap between the glass door and the hinge - it can make a big puddle on the floor depending on where the showerhead is pointing (stuffing a bit of paper in the gap seemed to prevent this happening after the first time). Breakfast Breakfast was well catered for but agree that the 10 euro price might not be worth it if you haven't got it included in your rate, especially if there's more than one of you. Tip here would be, if there's 2 of you, check out the breakfast inclusive and exclusive rate when booking - the price difference might make it worthwhile to include breakfast as it is substantial and you can eat as much as you can manage - it's good, and you can sit down and take your time. My standard breakfast was cereal with fruit and yoghurt, croissant or roll with ham, salami and cheese, finished off with a couple of sweet pastries, washed down with a cup of tea and orange juice - pretty much a bit of everything, and all very good quality and tasty. The breakfast area can seat about 20 people - popular time seems to be around 9:30 to 10 when there were some people who had to wait, so maybe have breakfast early to get a good start on the day. Hotel Hotel decor is nice and contemporary, I think final renovations are still underway. There is a lift (thank goodness!) but it's small and a bit slow. We used the stairs anyway as we were on the first level. There's also a complimentary english newspaper available (The Guardian). Reception is manned 24 hours and is in a pretty safe-feeling area. Location Location was in 11th arrondisement but pretty close to Bastille and Marais, a little bit off the tourist map, but with such great access to the metros (Rue des Boulets is about 1 min walk, and Nation is about 8 mins) no complaints. The location also provided a more local feel, which is better than the tourist areas where you feel everyone's out to rip you off. Location also convenient for RER stop (Nation station) so good for Disneyland Paris. We did feel that we saw an awful lot of the metro service, but that might just be bad route planning on my part). (Tip - the Rue des Boulets metro stop is closer to hotel than Nation but there're still a few steps and walking to get to the correct station for the green line - tossup between negotiating crossing the roads and walking a couple of blocks, or the hassle of changing for one more stop). We bought the carnet of 10 tickets for 11.60 which I think works out cheaper than the 1 day pass which is 5.60 each for zone 1, depending on how much you want to do in a day. Eating Plenty of places to eat around the hotel - they have a list of recommended restaurants and a map and indicative price range. We tried the much-touted Les Galopins - loved it the first time but not so sure the second - 2nd time round, they seemed to be short-staffed that night and completely different staff and food not to the same standard (eg burnt creme brulee) - true test of a dish is ordering the same dish twice though!. We had a starters, mains, desserts and a 46cl bottle of wine - cost was around 60 - 70 euros for two of us. Note that some of the starters are large (eg the pate and the foie gras) so might be worth sharing these or having a 2nd starter instead of a main. I have to say I enjoyed the starters and desserts more than the mains. Also liked the italian place right next door (my partner had a hankering for pizza) who were also just as friendly and spoke english with amusing english menu, food is pretty reasonably priced and good here too. If you want to look further afield, then try the side streets. One night we didn't realise the time when we got back (around 10:15pm) and many places were already closed - we did find a pub called L'armagnac about 3 blocks up Blvd Voltaire and just off the corner on the left - this was still serving food although it is more pub style (eg served with french style chips and salad) but really nice local atmosphere and some of the staff there speak english. Other comments - We tried the shuttle service that the reception very kindly organised for us - again nothing to do with the hotel, but the guy was about 30 mins late, and then got lost trying to find his last pickup (unfortunately this involved going in circles around several tight corners and narrow streets in the Marais district, including side-swiping a parked car) but luckily we had checked in online already so weren't delayed too much. Reason for choosing this hotel Primary driver for a hotel in Paris for us was price, and photos and comments from other travellers - when I first started looking for a hotel, this one was ranked #79 on Trip Advisor, and now it's sitting at #18 out of over 1,900 hotels (over a period of about 6 months) - which says quite a bit in itself. The lift, aircon, wifi and location were an added bonus. Extremely pleased with our choice, we had a fantastic stay - would thoroughly recommend.",

      "title": "Almost everything you want to know about Grand Hotel Francais",
      "text": "I thought for a long time about this review and the rating I would give this hotel as I know it is very important to the owner, and I wanted to be sure I was accurate. This is a Trip Advisor 5-star, French 3-star hotel. Before I tell you everything you want to know about the hotel, I need to digress a little to explain what I mean by the above comment because there is a difference between the French star rating system and the rating systems on websites like Trip Advisor, and the difference is important but not always clear. The French hotel rating system provides a standardized system of measuring all hotels in France based on 22 objective criteria, such as the size and number of room, heating and air-conditioning, design of bathroom facilities and elevators. Each requirement varies from one star category to another. So, when considering a hotel you need to consider its French star-rating. If you want a certain size room then you need to go to a hotel rated for that size of room; if you complain that you went to a French 3-star hotel and expected 5-star room size because it is a Trip Advisor 5-star hotel, then you are confusing the two rating systems. Contrary to the French star system, the Trip Advisor system is more subjective, such as quality of service. So, the subjective things about this hotel are wonderful! The service is superb at all times and in all things. The people at the reception desk are happy and friendly, always ready to help amd speak very good English. Even the cleaning staff smile and they are polite\u2014and our room was extremely well-maintained. One day we had to leave very early in the morning, before the breakfast was open, and made special arrangements were made for us to have food in the lobby before we left that day. Another day we had something broken in the room and there was someone there immediately to fix it\u2014with a smile and major apology that it had happened at all. As to the rooms, a regular issue specified about this and many boutique/small hotel reviewed on this website, they are small\u2014very small by US standards but not so small by many European standards. Going back to the French rating system, here are the requirements for the rooms in a 3-Star hotel: 1 person/ single room 9 square meters (97 sq.ft) 2 persons/double room 10 square meters (107 sq.ft) 3 persons/triple room 12 sq. meters (129 sq. ft) The rooms are at least this size, although not a lot larger. The size of the rooms are on the hotel website, so look at them and if you don\u2019t want the size listed don\u2019t book here. One thing to note is that \u201csuite\u201d here does not have the same meaning as in the US. In this hotel it simply means a little larger room with a sofa in it, not a second room. As is also common in Europe, there are no closets for your clothes. Basically you need to put your clothes in the bureaus and then your suitcases in a corner, or live out of your suitcases. The mattresses were quite good. The bathroom is equivalently small but fitted with very modern fixtures; no problem with hot water or water pressure. The towels are really quite nice, much better than most hotel towels even at very expensive hotels. The hotel provides only soap and shower gel, so bring shampoo and conditioner or plan to buy it in a nearby store. There is free wifi in the room and it works well. The tv is modern, works well and gets a number of channels. The free soft drinks shown on the website should not be interpreted as soda, but rather bottled water. In my opinion the breakfast is not what it should be, but it is served on Villeroy & Boch china. Nothing is hot except the coffee, but there is a very nice coffee machine which makes individual cups of a variety of beverages. Otherwise there are several breads, a few cereals, a 2-3 meats, 3-4 cheeses, fruit, yogurt, soft boiled eggs and weak, from concentrate juice. While it is self-serve, the auxiliary services to assist you are great and everything remains stocked until the end of breakfast. Other than small take-out only bakeries we did not see anywhere else around to eat breakfast, so likely you will need to eat it here but it is the one thing not worth what is charged for it. A few final notes: The hotel is less than a block from one subway station and 2-3 blocks from a very large subway station BUT it is not centrally located by any stretch of the imagination. It is a distance to get to anything a tourist might want to see. The hotel has many nice decorating features not seen in chain-type hotels. The elevator is quite small and not very fast. The lobby is very small but rarely used. There is a small bar in the lobby. I never saw anyone use it. Finally, I doubt you will find a proprietor who works harder or cares more about his guests then the owner, Zyad.",

      "text": "Grand Hotel is a truly exceptional hotel that punches well above it's weight. From the moment you walk in the door and are greeted in such a friendly manner to the au revoir when you depart you will feel like you have made friends. All of the desk staff we met spoke excellent English. The wine and chocolate in the room upon arrival only heightens your appreciation of their attention to detail. Zyad the manager is fantastic and the effort he goes to is evident throughout your stay and his effort is reflected in all the staff' that are employed at GHF. One example of the staff's dedication to service was seen on our last day just prior to check out. We were just heading down for breakfast and my wife asked one of the house keeping staff if there was anyway that my wife could do a load of laundry prior to our departure. Although the staff member was probably not the most fluent in English they she seemed to say yes that would be no problem. She waited at the door while my wife collected up the clothes she wanted washed. Instead of directing my wife to the laundry room the house keeper simply took the bag, said 'Merci' and left. We were both quite stunned by this and a little worried that there would be some kind of exorbitant charge for this deluxe service and that it would not be ready prior to our departure. Shortly after we finished our breakfast our clothes were delivered to our room by the same house keeper neatly folded and packaged in a plastic laundry bag which we promptly packed in our suitcase and headed downstairs. Upon check out there was no sign of the charge for the laundry service on our bill. Wanting to be honest and thinking that they just hadn't had time to enter the charge I told Zyad about the laundry and he informed me that there was no charge. I can't recommend GHF highly enough. There is no doubt that this is truly the best value you will receive for anything to you do or buy while you are in Paris. I look forward to returning",

      "text": "Located on Boulevard Voltaire and only steps away from the Rue des Boulets metro stop, the Grande Francais is a beautiful little boutique hotel with small, cozy rooms. Recently renovated, the rooms are furnished with good quality linens, comfortable beds, flat screen television and a modern aesthetic, with clean lines and simple furniture. All rooms are equipped with clean, modern shower facilities, with an option to upgrade to suite rooms with bath tubs. Check in went smoothly and the concierge was very helpful when it came to recommending local spots for groceries, breakfast or meals. We had no problems with our reservations being honored; however if you book a double room as a single occupancy, there will be an additional EUR20 charge if you want to change that to a double occupancy. The manager and staff are bi-lingual and go out of their way to help guests. The Grande Francais is not located within central Paris, but is a little further off the tourist track in the 11e, or 11th arrondissement. This adds to the local flavor of the neighborhood. There are numerous shops dotted around the streets and visitors can easily buy cold cuts, fresh baguettes or fruit. The breakfast offered, like most of Europe, is Continental-style and consists of pastries, bread, jams, coffee, tea and fruit. The food was adequate for the price charged. For a more authentic Parisien experience, eschew the hotel provided breakfast and hit the streets of Paris for a breakfast of croissants and coffee in a cafe instead. Unlike larger chain hotels, the Grande Francais does not have many amenities, such as a fitness centre or conference rooms. Guests are allowed to use the gym and pool of another nearby hotel for a fee of EUR20. There are also non of the vending or ice machines normally found dotted in the corridors of American hotels, though it is easy and convenient to pop down to the nearby shops for any items you require. Parisien hotels are infamous for their high prices, small sizes and not always clean rooms. For a comfortable, safe and clean space to rest your feet after a full day of sight seeing in Paris, the Grande Francais is a good choice for both business and leisure travelers. Prices are reasonable by Paris standards. The Grande Francais represents good value, tastefully decorated and comfortable rooms in an accessible location.",

      "text": "We stayed here in Nov. 2010, and were tickled to discover upon arrival that we had been upgraded to a corner room (# 23) with wraparound balcony, tub, shower, and a lovely gift left on our bed. It was my first trip to Paris and we'd done extensive research on hotels in the city before finally deciding to book with GHF. Let me say this about that: It was fantastic. First off - our room was fabulous. Disregard room reviews that complain about the size; I think it is more a function of what people in the U.S. are used to, not a genuine reflection of space. Our room was not a closet, it was not cramped, it was LOVELY. I am finicky about rooms and don't like scratchy linens or places that have a funny smell. No worries - it was clean, it smelled clean, it looked luxe and beautiful. When we return, we want to stay here again. Second - the daytime manager at the desk deserves his reputation as a helpful, gregarious, English Speaking charmer. He was great to deal with. The evening staff, while less outgoing, was no less helpful or pleasant to deal with. Their English is wonderful and you never feel like a nuisance coming to them for help or with questions. Third - Breakfast was really delightful. Fresh croissants, pain du chocolat, juices, tea, coffee, cereal, yogurt, fruit, cheese, meats (ham and salami) were plentiful and of excellent quality. Even the room itself - a little nook - is charming in its simplicity, the china is cheerful, the silverware and glasses gleam, and the whole affair is spotless and relaxed. The hotel is impeccably tidy and fresh. I did not find a single spot where it smelled musty or mildewed or stale, there was absolutely no dust anywhere, and everything worked as it should . The lift WAS tiny, but it worked smoothly, and there was room in it for us, our luggage, and another person, so no complaints there either. The (free) wifi worked wonderfully and consistently, which is patently not true of other places offering free wifi. The shower didn't have powerful water pressure, but the shower heads are great, and the volume of hot water was wonderful. Unlike a lot of cities (New York, Boston) , the water has no funky, chlorinated odor. The amenities (shower gel & hand soap) smelled good; and you get a loofah, plus slippers to keep. Even the toilet paper was significantly better than the shiny, super thin stuff you find in most places. The bed was fantastic, a thick, firm mattress with a dense, lush duvet , and two pillows. We both suffer from back problems and have difficulty with inferior mattresses, but we both slept like logs and woke up free from backache. The television worked, the wardrobe was spacious, the draperies were heavy and wonderful at blocking light / noise, and the sheers behind the drapes were wonderful for privacy but allowing lots of light to flood the room. The walls appear to be soundproofed and while you can hear people moving around, there was no noticeable sound of toilets, showers, voices, etc.. I wish the hotel were somewhat more central. It is the only thing I found myself wishing were a little better, but in the big picture, it didn't matter. The hotel was a wonderful, comfortable haven for us at the end of our days in Paris, and as I said before, we will definitely be back. Regarding location - the hotel is a matter of yards away from the Metro stop \"Rue du Boulets\", and a short walk from the stop \"Nation\". (I preferred using Rue du Boulets, but that is because it was a shorter walk and my feet hurt.) The neighborhood is delightful and genuine. Everyone we met was cheerful and pleasant. I spoke tentative, nervous French and most people answered me in English or very understandable language. Most people do, in fact, speak English but won't admit it until you've tried your hand at French. The manager at the GHF desk will give you a map of recommended restaurants and wine bars in the area, which was helpful. We ate at one of these, and it was reasonably pleasant. (Be advised - lots of places do not take Visa / MC.) There are a couple of Boulangeries in the road, one of which served us delicious baguettes and another served the most gorgeous pastry / confections I've ever had in my life. Just writing this has made me long to return. When we do, you can be sure we'll be staying at Grand Hotel Francais. Merci beaucoup!",

They even kindly upgraded me to a larger room when I advised that I would work from my room all day given they had availability. The rooms are designed with modern and chic furnishings and the hotel is located very conveniently to a host of great local restaurants in a safe and bobo area of Paris. Links to the RER and metro are only a few minutes walk. The hotel is always happy to arrange a reservation in a local restaurant when you wish to meet clients and friends and kindly organises transport very efficiently. The wifi is easily accessible and of a suitable strength for streaming video or handling Skype video calls with clients. The rooms are very clean and cleaned daily by staff. Free water is available in a small fridge in your room with tea and coffee making facilities. The bath is a good size for relaxing after a long day. The breakfast service is a good spread of cold meats, Parisian pastries and good strong coffee.The staff also can kindly deliver it to your room at a suitable hour. A basic bar service is also available in the foyer. Basic printing services are also on offer if you urgently need to print a document for business. We have stayed here with friends, family, my loved one and with business colleagues. It's great value for money and I can highly recommend it. It's my home away from home in Paris and I always look forward to coming back. It's not always easy to get a reservation as they are always very popular, so it's best to book well in advance to secure your room. Highly recommended!!!",

      "text": "Many rave reviews about this hotel but not quite sure why. I've been to several countries in Europe and this hotel is by far not the best. There are certain pluses but not enough to place it among top hotels. PROS: Location is good and Metro makes it accessible to central attractions in Paris. Our room was clean and easily accessible since we were on the first floor (I have a walking cane). Also, the individual who welcomed us on our first day allowed us an early check in since we were exhausted due to jet lag. We were also upgraded to a larger bed since I was with my son. Breakfast was Ok but redundant and not enough varied fresh fruit. CONS: In spite of the good volition of the front desk, we were \"upgraded\" to a room which was tiny (way smaller than I've been in). The room was located next to a lane way so that it was always very sombre (even with our curtains opened). We couldn't tell whether it was cloudy or sunny. The front desk was amicable but the individual (night attendant) was not that friendly and seemed to be annoyed when asked something. NOTE: Upon arrival, front desk asked us to fill in a card including personal information, such as passport number, date of birth, address and signature. We were asked to fill out cards with this info without being told why. I suggest that one checks with their embassy to find out if this is normal practice - it MAY be. However, I've travelled extensively in Europe (in France, only French Riviera and was never asked); The French government MAY request this but seems unlikely to me. The person at front desk mentioned that the French government requested this info from guests but only after I asked why he wanted this info. He was very annoyed by the fact that I asked for an explanaiton and retorted that he just upgraded me. I didn't understand how the two had anything to do with one another but....just I suggest one checks with their embassy.",

      "text": "I've arrived from an amazing trip from London on the Eurostar which was very interesting to experience going to Paris and the services on board was great for a two hour travel time trip there. On reaching to the downtown area of the train station we took a subway underground train to La Defense area to stay at the Hilton Paris area, however before reaching to the hotel we almost got lost and we had to ask questions in English and half of the persons didn't speak our language. We got a bit nervous while walking trying to reach to the correct area so eventually we saw a French native from Hati who speaks fluent English lead us the way on how to get to our hotel. We didn't realized that the hotel is located in a total different location from the main Paris area which they are now in the financial business district which gets real quiet at nighttime, and the hotel is right in the midst of adjoined to a big major mall and we got very lost finding the main entrance to get there until we had to ask questions once again, and we eventually found it after a long travelled night out from London. Upon arrival at the hotel front desk, the clerk was very pleasant, and she provided us with great services at checkin and gave us a nice room. My families didn't enjoy the location of the hotel due to we were looking for something real Paris setting with resturants with outdoor caf\u00e9 setting, beautiful hotels that is in the area, and museums and shopping etc. real lively city nightlife area. We eventually didn't stayed the complete full four night stay there because my families wanted to be in the heart of the major city centre area of Paris close to the arch which is one of Paris main landmark, but I must truly say that the hotel is really beautiful, nice hallways with nice carpeting, nice beautiful decors in the rooms and the main lobbly area was lovely and the staff were very accommodating and friendly. This hotel location is ideal for corporate business travelers who are just here for business and a few major resturants are there for dining and mall shoppers for local shopping area. We eventually stayed and relocated to another area close to Champs Elysees which is a most vibrant lively busy shopping area with lots of French quaint resturants, with lots of major shops and high end stores in that area and we were close to visiting the famous arch to take lovely shots there and the famous Eiffel Tower. I wanted to express a sincere thanks to Jan the night Mgr who was so pleasant, outgoing and vibrant and provided excellent services during my stay and also the the front desk agent who was very pleasant and finally Gino the restaurant mgr in the daytime (He was excellent and the best). Thanks Gino for a wonderful excellent service provided for me and my families and rest assure i'll come back again and stay there someday. This Hilton Paris hotel is fairly new at the La Defense area and it's in the heart of a real business district and it's about a 15 min cab ride to get down in the heart of the city centre of real Paris.",

      "text": "Traveling with my extended family, we occupied three rooms at the Hilton Paris la Defense for 5 days during our recent tour of Paris. As HHonors Gold member, I was upgraded to a relaxation room, while the other two rooms were guest rooms. All rooms were spacious, although I felt the guest rooms offered more space. The relaxation room,on the other hand, had a Jacuzzi with a hand shower, and a separate stand-up shower stall. The relaxation room overlooked the square outside the CNIT center, while the guest rooms overlooked the reception area. The lighting in the guest rooms were very low, and sometimes not enough at night, while the relaxation room was well lit. The staff were very friendly throughout our stay. Stanislaus at the reception especially was extremely helpful after we arrived very tired at night from London, as was Laurent Atyaty (not sure I'm getting the name right). The one exception to this great service was the cleaning crew who were very inconsistent with the quality of their service. On one day especially, they seemed very irritated when we were late leaving our room in the morning and asked them to come back later. Not what I expect from Hilton in a major city. Our room also had some some weird chemical smell on our last night at the hotel. Our room rate included breakfast, and I highly recommend getting a rate with breakfast since the posted rate is 20 euros per person per day for a full breakfast (although other cheaper continental options exist). The breakfast was usually very good, although towards the later times of the morning, it became very crowded. Fortunately, we experienced the busy period only once since we got out early on most days. Although located in the La Defense area which is away from most attractions in Paris, the hotel served us well as a base for our first trip to Paris. The subway is very convenient, and located right under the hotel, although I never had the nerve to try it without knowing French. We took cabs on several occasions. A taxi stand is located right outside the hotel which made it very convenient. We made several trips to and from the Champs Elysees area and our fare was anywhere from 9 euros to 13 euros one way (which I felt was very reasonable). Our one trip from Louvre to the hotel cost 18 euros. There are several take-out and dine in restaurants located in the immediate area, including a Starbucks, a Chipotle, and a McDonalds in the Le Quartre Temps across from the hotel. We made the Ching N'Ling, an Asian take-out, our home base for dinner. It offered very tasty, if limited, options for very reasonable prices. The Monoprix one floor below the hotel, and Auchan in the Le Quartre Temps (apparently the largest supermarket in Paris area) offer wine, water, fruits, and all other things for very reasonable prices. There are also several shops in the mall that are well worth browsing. Although wifi was free for me, the posted rate is 20 euros a day which I felt was excessive. The hotel does provide free wifi in the public areas for a limited number of hours. Travelling to CDG on the last day, we arranged two cars through the hotel. We had a Mercedez Viano for four of us which was very spacious. The rate was 80 euros which I felt was very reasonable since most fares I had seen online for similar private transfers were upwards to 100 euros. Overall, I think this Hilton provides excellent value especially considering its spacious rooms and low prices compared to sky high prices in areas near Paris city center. Although it is away from the major attractions, I did not think this affected our Paris experience at all.",

      "text": "Note: Would actually give 3.5 stars if available. Would be 4.5 if AC worked. Stayed here the entire 1st week of December. Very cool, modern hotel, located inside of a shopping mall. Gorgeous Grand Arch located outside, & charming Christmas Market just a few steps away. Nice lounge w/pricey drinks (18 euro for a cocktail) but, hey, it's Paris! Check in smooth & easy, we are Hilton Diamond, so received upgrade to view room of Arch & Xmas Market, very helpful front desk man explained metro location & where to purchase museum pass. He noted that we had specifically asked for either an opening window (there are none) or a room that had good working AC. Note that there is no snack/drinks lounge for Diamond Members, normally we would have been given bar vouchers for each day, but did not receive any. Not a problem. Room was spacious & immaculate, albeit a very, very funky smell coming from the tiny shower, but shower seemed very clean w/excellent water pressure. Bathroom nicely appointed w/whirlpool tub (which we did not use, come on, Paris awaits you outside! Lighting in room is very dim, even with all lights on, but it's adequate. Furnishings lovely & modern, w/clean lines & a very comfortable bed. Room seemed a bit warm, but AC was off, so we flipped it on full blast down to lowest temp & headed out to the Xmas market around 17:00 for a cheap & delicious dinner. Returned around 19:30 to a room that was like an oven, played with thermostat a bit to no avail, then headed down to front desk. He said the last customer must have requested to turn off AC (Huh?? why request this? Just adjust the thermostat yourself, right? We would find the answer to this little mystery on our last night) Anyhow, he played with the panel outside the room for a few minutes & assured me that the room would cool off soon. It didn't. We finally resorted to sleeping with our door propped completely open all night, as the hall way was comfortable. Thank goodness I always travel w/a tiny fan as this helped me sleep. I would have actually slept in the hall if we'd had an extra blanket. BTW, a little travel gadget we have noted our room temperature around 80 f. Showered, shampooed & dressed next day, room had cooled down to about 74F due to open hall door, bit strange getting ready w/door open, but hey, you do what you have to. Several staff the evening before & that morning stopped to ask why the door was open, we explained, hoping they would offer a solution, but none was forthcoming. BTW, very nice towels & soaps in the bathroom. Went to front desk to request repair of AC, kind lady offered us compensation, but I declined, explaining we just wanted to be able to control the room temperature & get a decent night sleep. Very nice included breakfast & free Wifi for Diamond members, hubby caught up on work emails & I planned our day. By the time we returned to our room, engineering was finishing up & our room started cooling off immediately. Hallelujah, problem solved! By 8:30 we were at the very convenient metro/RER station buying our passes & heading out to Paris proper, had an amazing day & returned to our lovely hotel to shower, watch some tv (there was a station with english dubbed documentaries) & sleep. Called down for two buckets of ice (no ice machine) & fresh towels for morning both of which arrived promptly. Room was on the chilly side, so I adjusted the thermostat, but nothing changed. Ok, so I just turned off the whole thing. Nothing changed. Apparently the thermostat is not actually hooked into anything, it's all controlled by that outside panel. Uh oh. Room got colder & colder as night wore on, in morning my little gadget read 58F. I'm comfortable w/that but poor hubby froze & slept w/his thinsulate hat on. We now realized we could either sweat in this room or freeze in it. After another wonderful breakfast (great coffee & service) & another amazing day in Paris, DH rigged some towels over part of the AC vent which made a big difference, the cold air was no longer blowing directly on him. On our last night, we return to hotel around 20:30. Room is hot again. I go to front desk to ask What The What???? & the response is, oh, they turned it off already? Apparently anyone who can turn it back on again has gone home, no solution is offered, other than turning off the entire system to our room to stop the hot air (80F) we opt for that, take cool showers, & once again sleep w/hall door open. We have another full day in Paris to look forward to, as we have an evening flight, & our plan is to just take quick morning showers, sight-see, & then do the full shampoo & shower before our 12 hour flight home. Unfortunately, in the middle of the night, a note was tossed into our room explaining that showers would be unavailable from 6am to 6pm, with strong wording suggesting, that unless you wished to die a horrible lobster death, do not attempt to use the hot water. OK. Took icy rinse offs, engineering promised to cool room down, front desk said we would be able to take real showers before we left. When we returned, room was still way to warm, but the open hall door helped, we packed everything, were able to shower as promised (water did fluctuate from cold to very hot, but just gritted teeth & took cold showers) got ready, & headed out. The hotel had arranged a private shuttle for us (55E to airport door to door, prepaid & no driving in circles nonsense. So here's my feeling: Lovely hotel, fantastic architecture, clean, nice gym, great staff. Clearly there are ongoing AC & Water problems, if you go thru the past reviews there are countless ones mentioning the same problem. I hope they find a permanent solution, because I would stay here again, but would not accept a room assignment until I'd checked the temperature of the room.",

      "text": "Took the Mrs. to Paris for her 40th birthday. It was her first time and our goals were few and far between other than to experience to day to day life in and around the city, spend a few tourist days and eat, drink and shop. We researched a lot of areas to stay and hotels and ended up staying at a Hilton property as we have status and time share points with the Hilton properties. I was worries the locations was too far off from the main parts of Paris, but I was wrong. The location is a great stepping off point for various wandering - is adjacent to a ton of shopping in the malls - and has a major transportation facility reachable from walking through the small shopping mall that the hotel is connected to. It's an odd hotel at first, when you find the entrance you must take an elevator or stairs to check in which wasn't easy to locate for a person unsure of the property, with wife asking questions and a pile of bags to handle. I wish there was a bell stand on ground level - but to the properties defense, we did arrive at 8am and I did see bellmen during business hours most of the time. There was a bellman but he wasn't at ground level and I am sure there are signs in French, which I am ashamed to say, I cannot read. Just a not to those who may arrive during off hours. I have personally spent some time in Paris over the years and it wasn't particularly one of my favorite cities, but after this trip and the wonderful experience had at the Hilton and surrounding areas - we can't wait to return. It's amazing how one visit can change one's opinion of an entire city, but this is the case with Hilton La Defese. The hotel is modern, well appointed and clean as one would expect from a Hilton in a large city. The staff and level of service offered at the hotel is what sets it far apart from all other properties I have visited in Paris. The lobby lounge is a great place to have a drink and snack... even though the prices are not inexpensive (but they are as one would expect at a comparable establishment), the convenience of taking the elevator home to your room and the service is all worth the small additional cost. Breakfast in the lobby resturant was a lovely surprise and was included in our package which in retrospect made the price of the rooms very good. It's is a beautiful setting overlooking either the indoor mall or the outdoor mall and surround tall buildings. The food is hearty or light depending on your desire,as it is buffett (but you can request omlettes and other breakfast items be prepared in kitchen) and even a foodies like myself and my wife found it far sufficient to keep us going all day until our daily ritual of finding a small , local, bistro and having a carafe or two of vino and some snacks late afternoon. This gave us so much free time to wander and explore (and shop). The service staff at breakfast went above and beyond to accommodate my vegetarian wife and me (her NOT so vegetarian husband)! I know it's frowned upon to tip like Americans in Paris, but I have traveled for thirty years and have never met a server that did not truly appreciated my tipping - I do a standard 15% -20% much to my wife's dismay and her travel book research recommendations. I waited tables for 4 years in college and I just can't leave the change... Sorry. What I found so exceptional is that after only two days, the staff knew that I preferred cappuccino and my wife preferred black coffee. They had it to us after only what seemed as a few minutes of being seated for the rest of our trip! I've stayed at Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carleton properties that didn't have service like this. It is nice to be remembered - take note \"other properties.\" Same could be said about the front desk service. I sent wifey to the spa one morning while I caught up on some work in the well appointed deluxe king room we had. Somehow, When I took a break to run down to little health food store in the mall to grab some vino, bread and cheese I left everything behind and locked myself out of my room. Didn't have my wallet, ID etc.- I went down to front desk and explained my predicament and they accompanied me back to my room, let me in, checked my ID (glad they did that) as if it happens all the time. I was so embarrassed, but they were so professional and weren't troubled in the least. One other thing about the front desk staff, they said \"hello\" and \"good evening\" with smiles every time we passed the front desk - which goes a long way for me! So many other hotels I stay at for pleasure and work have front desk staffs that are either overworked, distracted constantly or just plain not nice. Every person we came in contact with or even walked past smiled and took the time to say hello at the Hilton La Defense. Excellent training and happy people. Another great point to make about the rooms - I work when my bride watches movies or sleeps at night due to time difference from states and I usually bug her or keep her awake with calls or my typing away etc. - the manner in which the deluxe room is set up with a desk behind a divider wall was brilliant offering her the ability to watch movies or sleep while I worked. I was productive and she got rest and didn't even notice me working only four feet away! Great variety of full service restaurants, food courts, small eating establishments and stores where you can get anything within walking distance. The rest of Paris easily within reach with public transportation. Food in hotel other than breakfast was good as well. There are four restaurants open for lunch and dinner on mall level - all were excellent and offered fixed price menus. We are planning to head back to Paris next year and will without a doubt stay at Hilton La Defense... Best hotel in Paris from this cowboy's point of view.",

      "text": "The hotel is ok for people with meetings in La Defense area. Even if it's very convenient to go to Paris downtown from there, the place is not a romantic or glamourous one, it's a business area, without any interesting restaurants or caf\u00e9 to chill out. During the week end this part of Paris is almost dead (except the \"4 temps\" big mall... but there is much more better shopping area in Paris). The check in, people working there (from front desk, doorman, barmen or even reservation agent) are all great, Close from perfect. But i can't say the same regarding rooms... even if upgraded because of HH gold... the rooms are really so-so... less than so-so to be honest. The rooms are small, impossible to open windows, quite dirty (stains on the curtains, floor, armchair fabric..etc). Even if cleaning service sounds to be ok, they need to make changes regarding those stains, it... looks really disgusting. Impossible to manage the room temperature... wich is a real problem when you can't open the windows! No nespresso machine... wich is quite surprising for this kind of superior room (relaxation room). Bed is the worst i have experience in a Hilton. Bathroom is not at the hilton standards for sure (even if there is a bath + independant shower).... not clean, old, dirty tiled floor. Everything is old and tired... need to be change ASAP. Regarding amenities, nothing more than Hilton minimum package. No tv sound in the bathroom neither. Really bellow than average. Decoration is very cheap... paintings are cheap and look like ibis or cheap hotel ones... Cheap and not nice. The hall and public area are much more better and well decorated. The bar is ok but a little bit \"sad\" during week ends... no smoking lounge, you need to smoke outside. It's very surprising that there is no executive lounge (wich is a shame for a business hotel)!!!!!! I would say that for someone working or having meeting at La Defense, hilton can be a good choice (but Sofitel is much more better). For someone who wants to visit paris, they are much more interesting option at same price in Paris downtown. Was VERY disapointed by the room quality... this kind of dirty bathroom, old fabric is a shame regarding what a Hilton has to be. We have the feeling that this hotel works a lot for corporate people going the convention center (CNIT) and that hilton don't make any effort... intensive use of rooms at corporate rate... (-",

After another wonderful breakfast (great coffee & service) & another amazing day in Paris, DH rigged some towels over part of the AC vent which made a big difference, the cold air was no longer blowing directly on him. On our last night, we return to hotel around 20:30. Room is hot again. I go to front desk to ask What The What???? & the response is, oh, they turned it off already? Apparently anyone who can turn it back on again has gone home, no solution is offered, other than turning off the entire system to our room to stop the hot air (80F) we opt for that, take cool showers, & once again sleep w/hall door open. We have another full day in Paris to look forward to, as we have an evening flight, & our plan is to just take quick morning showers, sight-see, & then do the full shampoo & shower before our 12 hour flight home. Unfortunately, in the middle of the night, a note was tossed into our room explaining that showers would be unavailable from 6am to 6pm, with strong wording suggesting, that unless you wished to die a horrible lobster death, do not attempt to use the hot water. OK. Took icy rinse offs, engineering promised to cool room down, front desk said we would be able to take real showers before we left. When we returned, room was still way to warm, but the open hall door helped, we packed everything, were able to shower as promised (water did fluctuate from cold to very hot, but just gritted teeth & took cold showers) got ready, & headed out. The hotel had arranged a private shuttle for us (55E to airport door to door, prepaid & no driving in circles nonsense. So here's my feeling: Lovely hotel, fantastic architecture, clean, nice gym, great staff. Clearly there are ongoing AC & Water problems, if you go thru the past reviews there are countless ones mentioning the same problem. I hope they find a permanent solution, because I would stay here again, but would not accept a room assignment until I'd checked the temperature of the room.",

      "text": "The staff at the front desk were very polite, professional, and helpful. My room was good-sized, although it did overlook a covered interior courtyard and the hotel lobby, so there was little natural light. The room was tastefully decorated and had a rather large flat screen TV with CNN, BBC World, and Bloomberg. The location is outside of central Paris. It is conveniently located very close to the La Defense Metro station at the end of the Metro 1 line. The route from the subway to the Hilton is essentially unmarked, so it can actually be a bit difficult to find the hotel, especially after 8:30pm or so when the CNIT mall closes (which blocks the main passageway from the Metro to the hotel). The hotel is connected to CNIT, so it is a very conveniently located hotel if you are attending a conference at CNIT. The WiFi service at this hotel, which is provided by iBAHN, is absolutely terrible. Even though the hotel rates are extremely high, the hotel still charges an additional 20 Euros per night for WiFi service! This rate is ridiculously high, especially since these days a number of other hotels in Paris provide high-quality WiFi for free. For 20 Euros per night, I expected the WiFi to be very fast, but it is instead one of the most incredibly slow Internet connections that I have encountered in some time. It is so slow that it takes a few minutes just to download a file that is only 20 or 30 MB, i.e., a large presentation or a few large pictures. If the file is larger than that, then the system seems to freeze during the middle of the download and then terminate the download. I had a few iPhone apps in iTunes that had updates, and the system would inevitably only download at most 1 or 2 of the apps before freezing. One of the app updates was 45 MB, and I have been unable to download that update for 2 days in a row after trying several times. The WiFi service also seems by design to disconnect altogether after 2 or 3 hours, ensuring that any large file transfer that was not interrupted by the poor quality WiFi service previously is definitely halted. I spoke with other guests staying in different parts of the hotel, and they also complained that the Internet service was incredibly slow and seemed to freeze sometimes. The fnac store in the CNIT mall reportedly sells a 3G USB wireless data modem with a prepaid option (from the French SFR mobile phone service provider). The Les Quatre Temps mall across from the hotel also includes an fnac store as well as retail outlets for mobile phone service providers SFR, Orange, Bouygues, and Virgin Mobile. If you are going to stay at the Hilton for 2 days or more and you would like Internet access, then I suggest that you consider spending the Internet fee instead on a 3G USB wireless data modem with a prepaid option at one of those outlets.",

      "text": "Took the Mrs. to Paris for her 40th birthday. It was her first time and our goals were few and far between other than to experience to day to day life in and around the city, spend a few tourist days and eat, drink and shop. We researched a lot of areas to stay and hotels and ended up staying at a Hilton property as we have status and time share points with the Hilton properties. I was worries the locations was too far off from the main parts of Paris, but I was wrong. The location is a great stepping off point for various wandering - is adjacent to a ton of shopping in the malls - and has a major transportation facility reachable from walking through the small shopping mall that the hotel is connected to. It's an odd hotel at first, when you find the entrance you must take an elevator or stairs to check in which wasn't easy to locate for a person unsure of the property, with wife asking questions and a pile of bags to handle. I wish there was a bell stand on ground level - but to the properties defense, we did arrive at 8am and I did see bellmen during business hours most of the time. There was a bellman but he wasn't at ground level and I am sure there are signs in French, which I am ashamed to say, I cannot read. Just a not to those who may arrive during off hours. I have personally spent some time in Paris over the years and it wasn't particularly one of my favorite cities, but after this trip and the wonderful experience had at the Hilton and surrounding areas - we can't wait to return. It's amazing how one visit can change one's opinion of an entire city, but this is the case with Hilton La Defese. The hotel is modern, well appointed and clean as one would expect from a Hilton in a large city. The staff and level of service offered at the hotel is what sets it far apart from all other properties I have visited in Paris. The lobby lounge is a great place to have a drink and snack... even though the prices are not inexpensive (but they are as one would expect at a comparable establishment), the convenience of taking the elevator home to your room and the service is all worth the small additional cost. Breakfast in the lobby resturant was a lovely surprise and was included in our package which in retrospect made the price of the rooms very good. It's is a beautiful setting overlooking either the indoor mall or the outdoor mall and surround tall buildings. The food is hearty or light depending on your desire,as it is buffett (but you can request omlettes and other breakfast items be prepared in kitchen) and even a foodies like myself and my wife found it far sufficient to keep us going all day until our daily ritual of finding a small , local, bistro and having a carafe or two of vino and some snacks late afternoon. This gave us so much free time to wander and explore (and shop). The service staff at breakfast went above and beyond to accommodate my vegetarian wife and me (her NOT so vegetarian husband)! I know it's frowned upon to tip like Americans in Paris, but I have traveled for thirty years and have never met a server that did not truly appreciated my tipping - I do a standard 15% -20% much to my wife's dismay and her travel book research recommendations. I waited tables for 4 years in college and I just can't leave the change... Sorry. What I found so exceptional is that after only two days, the staff knew that I preferred cappuccino and my wife preferred black coffee. They had it to us after only what seemed as a few minutes of being seated for the rest of our trip! I've stayed at Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carleton properties that didn't have service like this. It is nice to be remembered - take note \"other properties.\" Same could be said about the front desk service. I sent wifey to the spa one morning while I caught up on some work in the well appointed deluxe king room we had. Somehow, When I took a break to run down to little health food store in the mall to grab some vino, bread and cheese I left everything behind and locked myself out of my room. Didn't have my wallet, ID etc.- I went down to front desk and explained my predicament and they accompanied me back to my room, let me in, checked my ID (glad they did that) as if it happens all the time. I was so embarrassed, but they were so professional and weren't troubled in the least. One other thing about the front desk staff, they said \"hello\" and \"good evening\" with smiles every time we passed the front desk - which goes a long way for me! So many other hotels I stay at for pleasure and work have front desk staffs that are either overworked, distracted constantly or just plain not nice. Every person we came in contact with or even walked past smiled and took the time to say hello at the Hilton La Defense. Excellent training and happy people. Another great point to make about the rooms - I work when my bride watches movies or sleeps at night due to time difference from states and I usually bug her or keep her awake with calls or my typing away etc. - the manner in which the deluxe room is set up with a desk behind a divider wall was brilliant offering her the ability to watch movies or sleep while I worked. I was productive and she got rest and didn't even notice me working only four feet away! Great variety of full service restaurants, food courts, small eating establishments and stores where you can get anything within walking distance. The rest of Paris easily within reach with public transportation. Food in hotel other than breakfast was good as well. There are four restaurants open for lunch and dinner on mall level - all were excellent and offered fixed price menus. We are planning to head back to Paris next year and will without a doubt stay at Hilton La Defense... Best hotel in Paris from this cowboy's point of view.",

      "title": "nice hotel, great location",
      "text": "From reading a lot of the other reviews on here, I would say this hotel has been unfairly maligned. Or perhaps I just had better luck than some of the other guests. I did get a room on the 4th floor (which has been renovated) so I did get lucky in that respect. Not only that, but I was a Priceline guest, and I didn't have to pay extra for the renovated room, either! I noticed the signs in the lobby stating that, as of mid-February 2006, the 2nd floor is under renovation. So perhaps they are getting close to being done - it seems they started at the top and are working their way down. I did peek into the 2nd floor from the elevator and honestly didn't notice a big difference in the hallway, but perhaps the rooms are not as nice. Speaking of rooms - ours was light and bright, and very comfortable. I did not find it to be too hot, although it did get stuffy one day and we opened the window briefly to air it out a bit. We faced the front of the hotel; with the window open, it was somewhat noisy, but with it closed we had no noise issues at all. Most importantly, the bed was really comfortable. I am American and find that European hotels' beds are often uncomfortable to me. In particular, the small, flat pillows are not pleasant; I like to have something substantial under my head. This bed was great, and the room came with several extra pillows to allow me to sleep in comfort. We had breakfast at the hotel only one day out of the four we were there. At 16 Euro per person, it seemed easy to do better for less at one of the numerous resturants and cafes in the area. (Besides, there's nothing like eating crepes for breakfast!) The one day we did partake of the breakfast, I felt like we got our money's worth. There was an extensive selection of both American and European style breakfast foods, and the breakfast area was nice. As far as the location: I grew up in a big city and have lived in urban areas my entire live. Maybe I'm not representative of many of the other reviewers who complain about the location. But, simply put, I couldn't see anything to complain about. The positives are that you're within a few hundred feet of the Metro and probably 100 (no exaggeration) restaurants/bars/clubs/cafes. There are also banks, pharmacies, an internet cafe, and two grocery stores, all within a 2-3 minute walk of the hotel. Absolutely everything a traveler might need is exceedingly close and convenient. The hotel is also located a short, pleasant walk to many major tourist sites. While we were there we walked to the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Petit Palais, and the Musee d'Orsay. If you want to go anywhere further afield, the Metro is literally right outside the front door of the hotel. This may be my personal bias showing, but I do not understand the complaints about homeless people, the sketchy characters who hang out on rue Berger, etc. as being negatives of the hotel. Would the writers of these reviews issue the same complaints about the Capital Hilton in downtown DC? This is an URBAN AREA, people. You should not be surprised that there are homeless people around. If you can't handle that, stay at a hotel in the suburbs. But don't complain when you make the choice to come into the middle of a very large city, or to stay there, and find that it's not like the suburbs. I would not characterize the people who hung out around this hotel as any different from those in any other major urban area such as, say, Times Square, or the area of downtown Washington near the Capital Hilton. If you are familiar with those areas, and think they are okay, you will be fine here. My only negative comment: the \"Place Marguerite de Navarre\", which is the hotel's mailing address, appears to be another name for the circular driveway in front of the hotel, and NONE of the taxi drivers knew where it was or could find it on their maps. The hotel should tell people an alternate address to give their taxi drivers, so the drivers can find the hotel. (to save you time: tell the drivers it is on Rue des Halles near Rue de la Lingerie)",

      "text": "Not a good start \u2013 Very bad service from reservations! Novotel does not honor its guarantee! I booked and made an advance purchase on Monday 7th May 2012 on Novotel\u2019s website for an executive room at Novotel Paris Les Halles for 4 nights in June 2012. I did not bother to compare prices on other websites and had peace of mind while booking on Novotel online reservation as Novotel prides itself for offering the lowest price with a BEST PRICE GUARANTEE. This turned out to be a BIG mistake as Novotel did not offer the lowest price and specially does NOT HONOR its supposedly guarantee! On the same day that the booking was made I found out that another website was offering a lower price per night for the same room with the same conditions at Novotel Paris Les Halles. I spontaneously went back to the BEST PRICE GUARANTEE Novotel page and followed the procedure to make a best price guarantee claim which was to fill in the formular online form with all the details of the claim. The next day I received an email from reservation.eng@accor-reservation.com stating that they do not deal with the best price guarantee issue and their guest relation office need to be contacted for same on accorreservations@accor-customercare.com . I was perplexed as to why the online form went automatically to them in the first place if they do not deal with it. Anyway I emailed their guest relation office as requested. The response that I got from them was \u2018we confirm your reservation made and that the reservation is an advance purchase which is not cancellable and not refundable\u2019. The response was definitely out of place and not even responding to my best price guarantee claim.

If that reflects the service of Novotel I regret booking from them and I\u2019m very anxious about my future stay with them noting very bad service from start, noise from surrounding construction and smoking rooms (that i read from other reviews).

      "text": "I stayed at the Novotel Les Halles from 7/30 to 8/1. The lobby is nicely decorated, fairly contemporary. I couldn't tell what \"motif\" this hotel was trying to portray. While the lobby is marble contemporary, the remainder of the hotel is anything but. In the hallways, you sort of get that \"industrial\" feel with the cieling in the corridors being a \"steel mesh\" where you can see the electrical conduits, piping, fixtures, etc if you look through the mesh. The signs in the corridors are on thick pieces of galvanized metal suspended by chains. The room numbers are written on the carpet floor. The room itself, very blah. While they are clean, they are very basic. I stayed in an Ibis in Amsterdam and this room was almost the same as the 2 star Ibis. The room is nice sized for a Paris hotel. All walls are white, with one off white wall paper. The toilet and bathroom are in different rooms. The bathtub/shower is rather cumbersome; watch out, I fell and tore down the shower curtain with me! Upon check-in, I was greeted by a very nice hotel clerk who spoke English well. Upon getting to my room (room 123), I noticed the toilet room absolutely WREAKED with urine. I went to the desk and did not find the same gentleman who checked me in, I was told by a female clerk to go back to my room and wait for mainenance. I told her I was not about to do that, after all, I didn't come to Paris to wait in a hotel room smelling of urine. Anyhow, when I went to get my bags, I found the head housekeeper. She agreed that the room was in terrible shape. I was moved to another room and found the room better, but not good. The beds in all the rooms are HORRIBLE! The rest on a hinge that can spring the \"matress\" all the way up to eye level. I don't know why this is, perhaps for ease of making up the bed for the maids. This part of the bed that is movable is made up of springs. The \"mattress\" is made up of a piece of foam. The bed wasn't uncomfortable, however, but I have slept in better. If you get up quickly from the bed, the spring set will knock against the hinges to make a slight noise, very distracting! I haver a sleep disorder that requires me to wear an electrical device at night. The plug in was across the room, so I needed an extension chord. The female desk clerk was very negligent in getting extra pillows and the extension chord to me, but when I talked with the gentleman who checked me in, they were develivered immediately. More advice: Skip the restaurant, extremely overpriced and the food isn't very good. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel without ever walking into the restaurant. Watch out for this area at night. Don't go walking around the Les Halles shopping \"mall\" at night by yourself, you are asking for trouble. It is not a very safe place to be. Around the hotel is okay though, but use good sense if you are by yourself. The area is considered to be a crime district. On the positive side: the hotel is in a GREAT location. You have the subway right in front of the hotel, perhaps 10 feet walk. You are a 15 minute walk to almost everywhere and maybe a half hour subway ride to everyplace else. You can take the RER to CDG airport or the metro subway to the Gare du Nord (or other railway stations for that matter). The hotel has a great air conditioning system for those hot Paris summer days. You also have a room safe for keeping things in a good place. Also, the hotel is very QUIET. I appreciated this. There is no traffic noise no matter where you stay in the hotel. Around the hotel is a pedestrian district, so no cars to wake you. Taking all of the positives and negatives into consideration, I probably would not stay here again. I did meet someone who works for the Paris tourism industry while in Paris, and he said the hotel has some renovated rooms. I booked my room on-line through a travel agency with a discount, so I'm sure the renovated rooms were not an option for me. Ask for the new rooms when arriving, perhaps you can be accommodated, especially if you are booking through the hotel. The hotel is owned by the Accor group, who own a variety of hotel properties that range from 2 to 5 stars. The Novotel is the 4 star group. The Novotel is just a 2 star room that is larger in size. The ammenities between the 2 and 4 star are almost the same (for instance, no glass cups in my room, I had PLASTIC). The furniture in my room was old and worn, it was plain white, and did not compliment anything else in the room. The carpet had no pile to it and was orange in color...very un-appealing. I also had a sofa with an orange cover on it, very cheap looking and blue curtains that had seen better days. The hotel is far from a four star it claims to be. Aside from a brilliant and convenient location, try someplace else for a better value.",

      "text": "Stayed here with my fiance for a week in early May: Overall - I did not expect much (having been in small cramped hotels in Paris before), and this place was surprisingly wonderful. Location - it is a five minute walk from the modern art museum (Centre Pompidou), a seven minute walk from the Louvre, a ten minute walk from Notre Dame and the Ile de Cite, a two minute walk from an extensive metro stop where many of the lines stop as well as the RER lines that get you to/from the airport. Service - I emailed the hotel prior to arrival to get directions from CDG airport - the directions were sent promptly, in English, and were perfectly useful and helpful. Check-In & Out were smooth - kind service in English (they appreciated my attempts at French). They were also very helpful with the wireless/wired internet questions that we had (the hotel provides it at a cost). Overall - kind, considerate, helpful. Also, room service was nicely priced. Hooray for Priceline. Room - clean. very very clean. Big room (American standards). Lovely and comfortable big king-sized bed (not two connected twins!) with clean comfortable sheets. Nice couch - nice tv, nice desk & chair, little fridge (mini-bar) which we used to store the cheese we bought on the trip, nice view of a beautiful church (Eustache), quiet, comfortable, good AC. Bathroom - clean. nice deep tub (if you're a fan of baths - it's lovely). good pressure in the shower. Separate toilet - nice and clean. Safety - never felt unsafe. Very popular and good location near a big shopping mall - lots of restaurants, cafes, and shops - always busy (and yet the room was quiet). I highly recommend it for a mid-budget trip - especially since it's so comfortable.",

      "text": "We just spent a very unpleasant 3-day weekend at this hotel property. The hotel detracted significantly from our otherwise lovely first visit to Paris. We arrived late Friday night, all ready to sleep but no one more than our 7-year-old. We got the key to the \"1executive room- 1 queen-size bed and 1 single sofa bed\" that I had explicitly reserved for \"2 adults and 1 child up to 16 years of age\". The sofa was not made up, so we searched for linens ourselves. When we found none, I called down and was told they would send some up. Meanwhile, my husband discovered that the thin sofa that my 7-year-old was hanging off the edge of was not an actual sofa bed. I called back down and when housekeeping showed up, the front desk representative was with him to explain how the sofa bed worked. Of course he couldn't, because it was not a sofa bed. We were soon moved to another room with a similar but convertible sofa that housekeeping had made up for our daughter...but hadn't removed someone else's razor and soap from the shower, or baby milk from the fridge; the mini-fridge was not restocked at all, meaning that I then needed to check in the morning to make sure we weren't being charged for it. One item needed to be removed from our bill. As we climbed into bed, my husband attempted to turn on the A/C. It didn't work. The unit didn't turn on at all. We slept that first night without A/C. On Saturday morning, my husband talked to the front desk about the A/C. They said they'd send someone up that day. We spent the whole day out sightseeing and arrived back to the room very late. It was a hot and humid day in Paris and we were sweating when we opened the door to...our non-air-conditioned room. I trudged down to the front desk, where the man was apologetic but there was simply nothing he could do at this time of night. He offered absolutely no explanation as to what kept anyone from doing anything all day. And so we spent yet another night of a hot, humid weekend in Paris without A/C in a room whose description on booking.com begins with the sentence \"This air-conditioned room has...\" The next day, we were moved into our third room in three days. This one had A/C. Housekeeping, when moving our luggage, was kind enough to move: the milk from the people before us into the new mini-fridge. It was the only almost-competent gesture in the hotel. The only thing anyone ever offered was to help us with our luggage on our multiple moves. A classy hotel would have offered to comp breakfast for the family not getting good sleep since the hotel wasn't providing air conditioning (or comp the room entirely for those 2 nights since A/C is in the very room description). Nothing. This hotel had the money for the prepaid stay and no incentive to keep this customer happy. They did not care how much of our time was spent re-packing, unpacking, talking to hotel staff, waiting for a bed. Nothing. To summarize: They did not put us in the room type we reserved upon arrival. They did not provide the basic service they claim to have in every room, for 2/3 of our stay. I therefore cannot call this hotel trustworthy, competent, high-quality, or customer service-driven. For what they charge and for being a \"4-star hotel\", they have 2-star services at best. Additional info- very convenient to metro. Excellent tasting but over-crowded breakfast buffet (crepes--yum). Tons of restaurants nearby. Louvre definitely within walking distance. Many shops on surrounding streets. Very convenient to get a cab. Construction (June 2014) obstructs view of church and confuses pedestrians trying to navigate the area. There's an entire mall across the street at Les Halles, but the mall is a nightmare to navigate under construction. The area was fine--the hotel just isn't where I would stay again, and I strongly recommend against it.",

Here's my comparison: Pros - If high speed, reliable internet access is what you need, the Novotel is for you. You can pay \u20ac13 for the high speed internet which worked really well for late night video conferencing meetings with New York. I thought this option was fantastic. Citadines had terrible free internet and no paid option. - Room service was useful when one of my late night meetings left me without dinner. I ordered the spaghetti and a soup and was happy. - Breakfast buffet offered a vast variety of options to fit any appetite. - The service at the front desk was exceptionally friendly and always staffed with many people, so I never waited too long for service. Cons - The room, compared to the Citadines rooms next door (which was 30% cheaper), was old, tired and small. I had to climb over my bed to reach the shower door. - The bathroom and shower were separate rooms on opposite sides of the room... Kind of weird. - Amenities were sparse compared to Citadines. No lotion. Shampoos and soaps did not get refilled when near empty. - Breakfast was incredibly crowded and some mornings I had to be at a business meeting, I had to skip breakfast due to the line. I thought Novotel was a business hotel brand and would have expected amenities for a business traveller, like breakfast-to-go. All in all, the Citadines was a better experience in comfort, but Novotel had the essentials I needed for business travel (internet and room service for late night meetings).",

      "text": "We stayed here for three nights in June...the location was fantastic to explore paris and ease to gare de Lyon and even eurodisney as you don't need to switch metro lines or anything. I was with my partner, my two nieces and their two grandmothers so we had two rooms..rooms are small and somewhat dingy (but with great brand-new flat LCD TV's), but along the back they have great views of Les Halles and a wonderful gothic church. I would not call this a four star hotel (see below), although the lobby and lobby bar look very nice. For what we were paying in central paris within walking distance practicalyl of everything I wanted to see, I thought it was excellent value for the money and would stay again. Now for the negatives: 1. The front desk!!! Message to management: HIRE SOME PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This hotel is gigantic with hundreds of rooms...now guess how many people are usually working at the front desk? Max 3 at any given time, and mostly just two; no manager in sight. It is complete anarchy and unacceptable for a hotel this size...check in takes at least 20 minutes and check out can be even worse depending on the time you choose. There is ALWAYS a line-up...if you want to call it that...people just sort of crowd around the desks as they are oval and nobody really knows how to apparoach that. Some of the staff frankly try their best, but I would imagine that the turnover of the staff is really high as it is so overwhelming that they must throw in the towel after a few months...it is really sad...BE PREPARED FOR THIS. 2. Certain front desk staff: some are angels and are only to happy to call a taxi etc. I had a horrible (and what most would call a typical rude parisian) experience with some poorly-trained estagiare who obviously thought herself above having to work at the front desk of a hotel...after an itialian family decided to make their own line-up along the front desk, I made sure that I was to be next to do my checkout. She told me that they were there first (they arrived 5 minutes after me); I told her that I was in the line long before them and that it wasn't my problem she wasn't looking behind the person she was serving (I mean, if the line up doesn't start behind the person that is currently being served, where is it to start!!??). There was this back and forth, which I find unimagineable that a counter person would engage in(and continue with). She should be fired for behaviour and disrespect like this. Arguing at the front desk of a hotel in front of 10 people?? Shameful. It ruined my whole stay. 3. Breakfast Buffet: be warned! get there early, or get there late! At 9am one morning there was a queue (at least it was being respected!) of probably 40 people and the breakfast room was packed. We ended up eating a wonderfully typical parisian breakfast at a small caf\u00e9 in the square beside the hotel out on the terrace in the sunshine, while parisians passed by on their way to work...do this at least once during your vacation, you will love it. While the wait for the buffet can be outrageously long, it is actually a good, well stocked buffet which I enjoyed. Despite the horrible woman at the front desk and the waits to check in or out, I still would stay here again for the convenience and decent price. But please, Novotel, if you read this, PLEASE hire more people for the front desk and it might be time to do a clean-up of your desk staff and a re-training in customer service, as this keeps your hotel from being considered a true 4 star...(read the rest of the reviews)",

We normally steer away from Ibis having have poor experiences in the past however this place does exactly what it says on the tin! It is very good value - we paid about \u00a3135 per room per night and it has all the amenities that you could want however in my opinion the main benefit of this place is the location; The hotel is situated approx half an hour by cab from the main train station Gare De Nord (awful place) and will cost between 25 and 50 euros by taxi for four people (we paid both 50E on arrival in a private hire car and 25E on return in a metered cab these seem to be much cheaper than private hire cabs without!) it is also fairly easy and much cheaper to travel to the hotel via the Metro, had we not had our luggage and two tired parents we would have taken this option, you can purchase a book of 10 tickets for 13E and it stops in the next street but one to the main hotel entrance (Cambronne station) it is also very easy to use although the connecting tunnels were very smelly however once in the metro you were only two minutes walk from most attractions across the city making this hotel an ideal base for exploring particularly as it is much cheaper than many others nearer the a Eiffel Tower. As with the majority of hotel rooms in the centre of the city these are very small, many previous reviews mentioned this prior to us arriving at the hotel however they really are very small, my husband is 6 foot 2 and struggled to fit in the shower, it was also impossible to dry yourself with the bathroom door shut however the shower although slightly well worn (what can you expect for the price?) was powerful and never seemed to run out of hot water and the hotel provided all in one hair and body shampoo which in my experience is unusual for Ibis (not luxurious by any means but it certainty does the job!) towels were replaced daily but were quite thin and small (a bigger selection would have been nice however again not a massive issue) rooms were cleaned daily and were spotless it was also a nice surprise to have independent climate control (again better than I expected for Ibis!) which came in really handy on the hot summer evenings. I called ahead to pre book rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower and would definitely recommend doing this as I believe from other reviews on here that they have a limited number however it is well worth the effort to get through via the central Ibis call centre. Although the views are amazing (will attempt to upload photos with this review) and it looks as if the tower is just around the corner it is approx 35 mins fast walk which was not ideal for my parents particularly in the heat, I would suggest using the Metro once again as this is only a couple of stops. Despite advertising international channels, the only English speaking channel was BBC world news however this was not an issue for us as we didn't visit Paris to spend time I'm our hotel room! The hotel has a small bar that was fairly quiet throughout our stay, we found it reasonably priced (compared to the rest of Paris which all seems to be horrendously expensive!) with a fairly good selection of drinks including local beers and champagne, they have a nice outdoor seating area which was very welcome after a long day exploring! Food from the bar appeared to be limited to choc bars and pre packed sandwiches however breakfast was pretty good, continental breakfast is not normally my cup of tea (no pun intended!) but this has plenty of choice of breads, cakes, fritata, crepes as well as meat, cheese, fruit and cereal more than enough to choose from and well worth the extra few \u00a3s considering the prices for breakfast elsewhere in the city (up to 12e for a coffee and croissant!) The road behind our room contained several bars and clubs and the window didn't have double glazing so on occasions there was a bit of noise however neither by husband and I or my parents found it particularly intrusive. The hotel operates a card system into the room which is also required to activate the lift, a small point that we felt provided added security. There are many caf\u00e9s and restaurants around the area several of which we tried and were quite impressed with, there is also a couple of pharmacies and corner shops as well as the most amazing bakery in the street behind - worth a visit for a treat! Be advised that should you need to leave your luggage between check out and departure as we did the hotel operates a locker facility, we managed to fit four cases into two small lockers meaning it only cost 6E again not a huge issue considering the overall total paid for the hotel but worth remembering that you may need to hang onto those last few spare Euros! Over all this hotel is not only a great value for money base to explore Paris is also went some way to restoring my faith in The Ibis chain, yes the rooms are small and it may be more basic than others in the area but keep in mind how much you are paying! Ibis is a budget chain and having visited Paris I now realise that I will need any money saved in booking this hotel as it is so expensive across the city! Great value I would look to stay again next time I visit Paris.",

      "title": "Good location",
      "text": "This hotel is located very close to the Cambronne metro station on the metro line 6, less than a 3 minute walk and approximately 30 minutes from Gard de Nord. The hotel reception is bright, modern looking and spacious. The hotel has 3 main lifts to access the several floors, you do need to swipe your room card and select your floor level to access the floors every time you use the lifts. You also get access to free WiFi around the hotel including your rooms, connection is quite strong, although we were staying on the first floor so not sure if the signal gets weaker the higher up you are but mine was more than sufficient. I had booked a twin bed room with breakfast at this Ibis hotel. I did read reviews that the rooms and the en suite bathrooms were compact and also the breakfast buffet selection was limited but as I was just looking for a base to stay, I wasn\u2019t too concerned about the size of the room as long as it was clean, warm and comfortable. As I entered our twin bed room, I first noticed how small the actual room was but I was expecting this from reading previous reviews, although the room was clean, with twin beds, a desk and a bench, a standard Ibis finish but on a smaller scale. The room also had a TV that was mounted on a unit, which also provided a clothing rail on either side that held around 5 hangers on each side - very compact but good use of features. I was aware of reviewers saying the bathrooms were compact but I was really surprised in how \u201ccompact\u201d it actually was! There isn\u2019t much space in there at all but saying that, everything was clean and in working condition. The water was very hot for both the hand basin and shower but able to adjust the settings. The shower water pressure was very good. As we were out most the time and using as a base it was fine, it got chilly in the evenings and the room has a small wall heater but it didn\u2019t really warm up the room but it was fine. Our room also came with a portable heater, although we did not use this but sure this would have been sufficient to warm the room up properly if we really needed to. The beds were comfortable and the duvets were fluffy and warm, as we left the heating on overnight it got really warm so we turned down the heating and the next night I turned them off completely, the duvets were nice and toasty! Breakfast was located on the ground floor, in a spacious restaurant. The breakfast buffet stations were dotted around and the hot/cold beverage machines were also dotted around quite well so not a massive wait to make your drinks. The buffet offered a continental spread that was sufficient to get us through to lunch, although a limited spread compared to the other Ibis hotels I\u2019ve stayed in Europe. I have to say they replenished the food quickly and I loved their warm croissants and mini pancakes. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming, both check-in and check-out was straight forward. The only thing I didn't like was the charge for the lockers to keep your luggage, so far this is the only Ibis or any hotel where I have stayed, that charges for this service. This hotel is more than sufficient as a base and close approximately to some major sights in Paris and with access to public transport, which is 2-3 minutes walking distance to Cambronne and 5 minutes\u2019 walk to La Motte-Picquet \u2013 Grenelle. It\u2019s about a 20-30 minutes\u2019 walk to the Eiffel Tower, if you want to get the train, I would say you are better of getting the line 6 to Trocedero as opposed to Bir-Hakeim, that\u2019s about a 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the station and a lot of people using this route. As soon as you get out of the Trocedero metro station you turn the corner and you are greeted with the grand view of the Eiffel Tower. Walking to the Eiffel Tower from the hotel is a nice leisurely walk, you are on the grounds of the Champ de Mars within 10-15 minutes from the hotel and you get the view of the monument as you walk up to it. We arrived in Paris via the Eurostar to Gare du Nord and used the metro to get to the Ibis. I found the recommended route was to get the metro line 4 and changing at Gare Montparnasse to change for line 6 to Cambronne, which was a 30 minute journey. Although the interchange at Gare Montparnasse was over a 5 minute walk to access line 6 with a lot of stairs and also a busy interchange. We found that going to Raspall then getting a train from here was much better, yes it means going back on yourself by a couple of stops but there are only two sets of stairs to climb/come down and less crowded and trains are emptier so better chance of getting seats. The area around the hotel has a fair amount of restaurants and a nice bakery. We ate at the Royal Cambronne restaurant, a nice restaurant with a live band on the night so quite lively - bit hard to have a conversation but good ambience. The food was tasty but quite pricey, I was very shocked to see that ordering 2 cokes cost almost 8 euros each! We couldn't see the price on the menu but seeing cocktails for just 8 euros which is approximately what it costs in the UK I assumed soft drinks would be much less! Bit of a shocker when the bill arrived! Overall, if you are looking for a good location with easy access to the main attractions and a clean room to sleep, a nice warm shower, this is the place to stay but if you are looking for some luxury then this isn't the place for you.",

      "text": "I had stayed here for 2 nights, and then moved to another part of the city last month during my visit to Paris. They have an online check-in process if you book directly, but not sure how is that helpful really. The reception has a couple of stands with laptops and 1-2 people roaming around, without really caring as to whether a guest is here for check-in, check-out etc. Some of the hotel staff really need some training regarding how to deal with guests in a polite manner (or maybe how to have a fake smile atleast instead of an i dont care attitude). The check in time was 12PM, and we reached 5 minutes before that. There were around 20-25 people waiting in the lobby and the staff really did not care about what was going on. So, after 5 minutes or so I walked down to one of the hotel guys and asked about my check in. I was told to come back after 20-25 minutes as they haven't started the check in yet - all idle, but still did not start the check in. So we waited in the lobby and saw people coming in groups after us, and getting rooms before even we can be attended to. There is no systematic process, and its all random there. Thankfully, a lady staff saw us waiting, and helped us with the check in process, which was actually very fast (provided the staff attend you on time). Looking at the attitude of the staff, we were least interested to even check the restaurants thinking what would the service be like. Regarding the room and the bathroom size, I know that the typical management response would be that it meets Ibis standards etc. But be very clear, the rooms are small, hence be careful with opening your large luggage inside. And as far as the bathroom is concerned, if you can fit it, you can well manage it very well. I have stayed in other Ibis (even in Paris) and the bathrooms are more spacious than this one. The rooms are very clean, and the staff do a good job of maintaining this property. The beds and pillows are comfortable and you will have a good sleep. I had read in one of the reviews regarding a peculiar fire alarm going off at night when you would be asleep, and yes, it happened when I was there, around 5 AM or so - and I am sure this was not by accident. All guests were surprised with what was going on, and everyone had to evacuate outside to the safe area on the streets. But the worse part was - the hotel staff seemed unaware and were least bothered with what was going on. The only good things about this hotel is the location, close to Eiffel Tower as well as to the Cambronne metro station (which can take you to other places). There are a few good restaurants around too. But if you can find a better hotel, at a better or similar rate, go ahead. For the average service it offers, I found this a little expensive and not worth the price.",

The restaurants around the hotel and slightly further afield are good Quality and i will review them seperately. The check out was very painless and very smooth, the only thing that stops it from being 5 Star rating is the Hotel was unable to cope with a rush in the morning for breakfast so we just went after the 8-9am rush and had no problem.

      "text": "I just came back from a 2-day stay at this hotel. I booked it after reading the reviews on this website. I was impressed! I'm very much a low-budget guy, having stayed in youth hostels for about 2 years of my life. These days I'm a bit more settled down so I wanted a nice and simple hotel to stay in with my girlfriend, but I don't need any big comfort/pampering and I wanted a good price. We were going to see Paris, not spend time in a hotel room so a bed and shower was all we needed. This was the idea in the back of my mind when I picked this hotel. As I said, I was well impressed. The room was clean and large enough, it didn't feel cramped. There was even a little desk with a chair, and a TV (which we didn't use at all). No aircon available in any of the rooms in this hotel, I didn't expect one for the price. I didn't mind but it can get hot in Paris in the summer so keep that in mind if you can't sleep when it's hot. Check-in was very quick and uneventful, the hotel has a very modern businesslike but cheerful style, and I found the room to be well-designed. I read here and there that it's bland but for the price I found it great. The interior is much nicer than your average motel, for example. The bathroom was small but if you're a normal-sized person you can easily move around in it without having to restrict yourself. There's no bath, only a shower. Once again, I wouldn't expect one for the price. The bed was nice and big. I didn't measure it but I suspect it must be a queen size bed, as it was a bit larger than our double bed at home. The pillows were a bit soft for my liking but I didn't ask for other ones. Last of all, the location was great. It's about 1 km to the Eiffel tower, and it's easy to find. Right next to the Cambronne subway station and literally 1 minute away from the next station which is on 2 lines (going north as well), so you can easily get to the Seine area. It's not as close to the Eiffel tower as the name of the hotel ('Ibis Cambronne Tour Eiffel') would make you think though. Our room had a great view of the tower, but when looking at the map it seems that most do not. It looks like only the rooms in the back of the hotel (and then only the higher levels) have a good view of the tower, so if you want a romantic touch I would ask for this upon booking. It was nice to see the tower all lit up and flashing as it does several times a night. Staff were friendly, Breakfast was reasonable but I would opt out, 6.50 for a few slices of toast and a croissant is a bit too much for me. The outdoor courtyard is cool though but don't leave your food unattended because the local pigeons will storm it as soon as you turn your back :) We didn't have dinner there, there's a few really nice and cheaper places to eat in the area. The area did feel safe at night, there was none of the scruffyness we found in other places in the city. So I can really recommend this place. If you're on a budget, want to be reasonably close to everything but still don't want to compromise on the basics, I would go here.. I would certainly stay here again myself.",

      "text": "I wouldn't normally write a review of an Ibis, as they are all much of a muchness comprising a decent standard of basic accomodation in usually a convenient location. The reason that I've bothered this time is more about the fact that I used to stay in this hotel regularly on business between 1996 and 2001, and had not visited until my business took me back overnight to Paris in January 2009, and I was somewhat intrigued to find if in 8 years away anything had changed. The short answer is no. Still clean, tidy, comfortable, slightly utilitarian, but ever so convenient. Still had a view (just if I craned my head!) of the Eiffel Tower, the bar still served cold beer, and the decent little restaurant just around the corner from the hotel (La Place) still served decent food. So there we are, simple, straightforward, clean, tidy, well located, friendly enough staff, good value and approximately 75 metres from Cambronne Metro. Ideal for a business trip in central Paris, not that special for a weekend break with a loved one, but does exactly what it claims to do and for me that means its perfect. I would happily stay here again if my business keeps taking me back to Paris.",

Eiffel Tower is nearby, of course, and a metro station just across the street. \u2022 cute lobby decor and bar \u2022 very welcoming Okay, now let\u2019s talk about the negatives. Here, I will share my story rather than bullet points, so get ready. My friend and I booked this hotel through Priceline negotiator (hello, William Shatner) and got it for a good price. We arrived on May 8 around 8:30 p.m. and were greeted very nicely. We stayed in this room for two nights and it was fine. May 10, we woke up and my friend pointed out A DEAD COCKROACH on the floor. I was disgusted, and very surprised. The hotel was not gross, yet there was a cockroach. We quickly gathered our things, called the front desk. While doing so, I noticed the cockroach was still alive. I was spooked. We got out of there, and they gave us a new room promptly, which was nice. I appreciated that, but lowkey I wished they gave me a refund. We go up to our new room and all is well. Not a roach in sight. We try and plug our things in, and boom.... no power. The lights were working fine, but the outlets... not so much. We called the front desk, and they said a technician would be up soon. The technician never showed up. So, we called the front desk again and they said a technician would be up at 10 a.m. We left for lunch and activities, and when we got back to the room, the power was still not working. Apparently, he never showed up. It\u2019s about 4:30 at this point. We called the front desk again and they said a technician would be up soon. He never came. So we went to the front desk and a woman was very helpful and nice. She told us a technician would be up to help. I watched her call him. The technician never showed up! We called the front desk again and he said the technician told him the power in our room hadn\u2019t worked for some time. He offered to give us a new room. FINALLY! Why couldn\u2019t they have told us this to begin with? So finally, we go back down to the lobby and speak to a guy to get our new room. He tried telling us it was just the converters we had, and the room was fine. Nope. Luckily he gave us a new room and we were on our way. That room was also fine. The outlets worked and no cockroaches were present. On our way out May 11, I did see a live cockroach on the floor in the hallway. If you do book this hotel, note this may be an issue.",

      "text": "We stayed at the Royal Magda Hotel for 4 nights. It was a very good hotel that we'd stay again if we were to visit Paris. The hotel was clean and simple. The room is not huge but was large enough for our busy trip. The elevator is small so it may take a couple of trips up to bring up your luggage. The hotel staff was great. Friendly and helpful. They remembered that it was our 10th Anniversary and gave us a bottle of champagne and snacks with a nice letter on it. That was very thoughtful. Other places we've been to have not been as thoughtful, even though they may be 4 or 5 star hotels. The staff at the hotel also were helpful in that they told us where everything was, laundry, stores, exchange places, Air France Bus, restaurants, etc. The location of the hotel was great. Very close to the Metro Station. About a 3-5 minute walk. Overall, the hotel was private, but there is a bar or club nearby and we could hear general people noise in the early morning hours (although it did not bother us since we were on the 5th floor and we would go to bed after the crowds and people left). As for breakfast, there are a few places nearby that serve very good deals. There's a McDonalds at the end of the block which has a very good deal for breakfast. Also, on the other side of the block there is a nice bakery that opened at 10am. We did not have a chance to actually eat there, but the food looked delicious. Across the street, there was a sandwhich shop that we grabbed a salad and panini for lunch which was delicious. Most places did not open up until 10am, but there were a few around that did open up earlier including a bread/bakery/sandwhich place that was a five minute walk away from the Arc D'Triomphe. Another helpful aspect of the hotel was that they helped me check in the evening before our flight. Although we attempted to print our boarding passes (we could not since it was apparently an international flight back home), because we did confirm our flight, even though we were late to the ticket agent (we were 3 minutes late), because we had checked in already, they let us go through without sending us out on another flight. Thanks, Royal Magda Hotel for helping us out on that one! We did buy an international phone card for 15 Euros on Ave McMahon, which was very easy to use (although we did not know the amount of minutes left since it was in French). We bought the 10 ticket Metro Carnet of tickets which was easy to use (but not quite as easy as the London Oyster Card) and please note that you can use the ticket for up to 90 minutes after first going through the gate. If we new this, we would have saved us some money. This was particularly helpful when we needed to change stations, etc. Overall, a few things to note that we enjoyed: We found Versailles incredible. You can spend a whole day there and have an enjoying time. Don't miss the small village which Marie Antoinette created, it was a joy to simply walk around the garden area and visit the live animals grazing there. We did not have time, but the bike rides looked fun. The Chateau was a bit hectic and crowded, but the size of the palace was very impressive. The garden is just gigantic and almost appears like a movie set...I could not believe how enormous the garden was! To get to the Versailles, you need to make sure you take the RER C train at only certain stations (the ones listed on Rick Steve's Paris book) and look for the \"Vick\" train that takes you to the end of the line, Versailles Rive Gauche. Once you get off, follow the crowds, or make a right out of the station then a left at the intersection and you will see the Palace up on top of the small slope. Make sure you have the Museum Pass or some other pass to get in by simply going through the glass entrance in the middle. Once in the main area, it's a zoo, but I would recommend getting tickets for the audio guide which was helpful. We also used the train service to take us places on the grounds which was useful since the walk is very far (appears to be about a mile or more to get from one end to the other). The Louvre was very hectic, but the museum pass helped to get in quickly. Once in their it is also a zoo, especially to see Mona Lisa, Venus De Milo. We liked the Musee d'Orangerie which had two rooms made especially for Monet (or vice versa). We enjoyed Rodin's Garden which we wish we had time to spend there. d'Orsay was nice, but like the Louvre very crowded. As for food, we ate at various local places around the city, nothing too expensive. The prices were fairly reasonable and you can get an Entree, Plat, and Desert for about 25-35 Euros. We would also recommend a place for Macaroons, at Pierre Hermes located in the St. Germaine location of Paris. Very tasty and fancy Macaroons. We walked around the Isles which was very nice and ate at a Bistro in the area. Overall, Paris was a nice place to visit. The people were much more friendly than I imagined and went out of their way to help us find places. Moreover, the Metro made things easy to get to places. The only issue is that the city does tend to be dirty. A lot of graffiti and people smoking all over the place. The Metros are a bit dirty as well. It makes me think of what the New York Subways were like back in the 80s. Moreover, the graffiti reminds me of LA freeway walls. We visited London at the same time and London is much cleaner (but seeminly more crowded and the same number of people smoking). We enjoyed walking around Paris more than London, though.",

      "text": "This could possibly be the best value hotel in Paris, but I must admit that I haven't stayed in that many Paris hotels. That said, I have stayed in a lot of other hotels around the world, and this one ranks very highly against all of them in terms of value for money. Don't let the term \"value\" throw you off, this is still an elegant and immaculate boutique hotel, just not with the boutique price tag, and admittedly, not all the boutique little extras. I spent four nights on a combination of business (in La Defense) and leisure (with wife and baby) and it met all of my needs and much more. Pros: Some of the best staff I have ever encountered. Great sidestreet location in Etoile, just two blocks from Arc de Triomphe and Metro Line 1 which leads to central Paris Very clean and well-equipped room Building with lots of character and original features, but completely modernized. Cons (very minor): Rooms are smallish, but pretty sure you wouldn't get bigger and same quality for the same price anywhere else.",

      "text": "As stated I am the event organizer for the non-profit For A Cause, www.rfac.org. I selected Hotel Royal Magda as the pre and post hotel accommodations for our France 2011 trip. We stayed at the hotel on 3 separate times during our trip to France this September. The hotel is exactly what it claims to be, a small European style hotel. If you are looking for a big American style hotel look elsewhere, as you will not be happy. The hotel was in a perfect location for us, just around the corner from the Arch de Triomph which also just happens to be a major stopping point for several Metro Lines making it very easy to get around the city. NOTE \u2013 when leaving the station, look for exit # 4 Wagram! We found the best way to get to and from the airport was via Super Shuttle or the AirFrance Shuttle, if you only have an overnight bag then take the Metro, but do note you will need to transfer trains and there are lots of stairs and we did not find an escalator. The hotel is located on a small side street, about the size of an alley, which is not listed on many maps. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of everything and the street is active with local bars and a playhouse located directly across the street and as such there is city noise, but we did not find this to be an issue we live in the city (Chicago, NY, LA\u2026). Also, the windows are double sealed which blocks out just about all the noise. If you are looking for a hotel where you will wake each morning to the sounds of chirping birds and crickets you should not be looking for a hotel in Paris. Check-in \u2013 Again, the hotel is small and so is the lobby. As I mentioned we stayed at the hotel on 3 separate occasions during the length of our stay, we were in rooms 112, 312, and 612. We booked club double rooms and were there for 1-night, 4-nights, and 1-night respectively. Check-in went smoothly all three times, on our first visit arriving for the US, our rooms were not ready (we were early), but the hotel offered to stow our bags, offered coffee and a snack and then we went for a walk. When we returned our rooms were ready and we took the small elevator to our room. I have read peoples negative comments about the size of the elevator and it is true it is very small, about enough room for 1-person and 2-bags. So you take turns, there is no reason why everyone needs to get to the room at the same time. Relax folks you are on vacation and things run a little different in Europe than they do in the US. The elevator was reliable and in working order for our entire stay. I have been in other similar sized hotels that did not have an elevator, so the shear fact that there is one was a plus for us\u2026 On our return visit there were 12 of us check-in taking 7-rooms, we lined people up outside so as to not overwhelm the lobby, the check-in process or the elevator. All our rooms were ready and the check-in went very smoothly. On our final return it was just the two of us and again we had no issues checking-in. The rooms \u2013 112, 312, 612. As I stated earlier, we booked club twin rooms for me personally and several other type rooms, including club double, standard double and single rooms. I will not speak for the other rooms, just the rooms I personally stayed in. Rooms 112 and 312 are identical to each other. The room has 2 twin beds which are pushed up to each other with a night stand on either side. There is a small desk, fridge, coffee machine, very small safe (not big enough for an average size lap top, but maybe an ipad), and a place to hang some clothes. There was room to put out 2 large suite cases, but you will be bumping into them\u2026 The rooms had double doors, which blocked out noise from the corridor and as I said earlier the windows are sound blocking. You can also close the shutters for added noise reduction. The rooms are small, but about average for a European hotel. The rooms are not designed to be spend any quality time. It is a room to get a good night sleep and a nap in the afternoon. Really you should be out seeing the sights of Paris and not spending it in your room\u2026 If you want a large room so you can spend the day in it then you should check your self into an American style hotel. Bathroom \u2013 is very small. Only one person can be in the bathroom at one time (and do you really want to be in the bathroom when there is someone else in there\u2026? OK, maybe when you are trying to get ready for dinner...) There is a small sink, toilet and a small tub with a hand held shower on a pole. As is typical in European hotels there is no shower curtain, but a \u00be glass divider and yes water gets everywhere\u2026 One note the ventilation system did not work very well and the room gets very steamy when taking a shower. Room \u2013 612 \u2013 On our final return to Paris for one night, we were put into room 612. As I noted I booked club twin rooms for myself and this is the only room that I would have complained about, but I did not. We were only there for the one night, but this room is even smaller than the other 2 rooms 112 and 312. I am not saying I should have received any special treatment, but I was the organizer for the group and booked 60+ hotel nights during the month of September. It would have been nice to maybe have one of the rooms I previously stayed in or maybe even an upgrade, the hotel was not fully booked. Again, I did not complain we were already in our room and it is on the 6th floor. If we were going to be there longer or when we go back, I will ask for a different room. Checking-out \u2013 was just as easy as check-in, but I did book as a group so things are a little different for us. Front desk \u2013 was exceptional they answered all our questions and were able to get us last minute reservations for a group of 14 in some exceptional restaurants. I and I think everyone in our group would stay at this hotel again!",

Orignally, I had booked a different, lower cost hotel with comparable amenities. However, the other hotel did not provide shuttle services to/from the airport. At the suggestion of my family, I booked Hotel Magda since their website stated they will help arrange for shuttle service and we had already booked Hotel Magda for a return to Paris later in the week. I had booked reservations for 3 deluxe suites and 1 junior suite. The cost of the 4 rooms was double that of my previous hotel reservation elsewhere. This was, after all, the first time we had been in Paris and not having to worry about transportation to the hotel was one less thing to worry about. So we booked this hotel... I had emailed back and forth with the hotel regarding the shuttle service. I was informed a week before we arrived, that service was prepared for us. Upon arrival at Charles de Gaulle Airport, there was no shuttle to be found. I contacted the hotel and was told that shuttle service was supposed to meet us there. I called again and was asked for confirmation numbers that I was not given in my email correspondences with the hotel. After an hour of waiting and calling the hotel back and forth, my family ended up taking Ubers to get to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, the staff was very apologetic... however, when it came time to check in, they didn't have the rooms I reserved. They had 2 deluxe suites and 2 junior suites. I asked the front desk staff to check my reservation and they admitted there was an error on the hotel's side. The hotel was already fully booked and they could not give us all the rooms we reserved. I was disappointed to say the least. But we took what we could because we did not have another option. When we checked out, I asked that the charges be adjusted for the lesser room. Unfortnately, that did not happen. I was charged for the 3 deluxe and 1 junior suite. I said that it needed to be corrected and that the hotel manager should contact me. I left my email and phone number. I did not get any call back nor an email. Later in the week, my family returned to Paris and since we already had prior reservations here, it was too late to change the reservation and find another hotel... Upon our arrival, I expressed my displeasure that the hotel management did not contact me regarding the erroneous charges. I was asked to email the hotel regarding their error. I do not think it is my responsibility to email the hotel to start correcting their charges. I informed the front desk staff and they in turn informed management. That should have been enough. When we arrived, our rooms were actually ready. However, the room I was given did not have a working bathroom light. We went to the front desk and the British woman at the desk said she couldn't get someone to fix the light until 2 days later. This was unacceptable, she wanted us to stay in a room without a working bathroom light! We asked for another room and after another staff member took over, we received the same room we had stayed in earlier in the week. However, it smelled like cigarettes... we expressed our concern and I was asked again to email the management... Other than the British woman at the front desk, the hotel staff we interacted with were very nice. I hope I spell their names correctly, but Ziana, Bobakar and Elwin (Elwin was the best) were very good to us. They understood our frustrations and tried to make things right. Elwin especially went out of his way to help us get what we needed. From what I understand, this hotel was bought out after we made our reservations and the owner and staff were not the ones who we had initial contact with via email. I would give a little leeway for the change in staff. However, management should have gotten back to me to correct the charges. Instead, I am now dealing with my credit card company to investigate the incorrect charges... This hotel is close to some good shopping but other hotels are close to other city attractions. also, there are other hotels out there that charge less for the same or better rooms. As of this review, I have not heard from the hotel management regarding the incorrect charges... I wonder if my experience would have been better with the previous owner and staff.

We chose the hotel based on tripadvisor reviews, plus the fact they offered a reasonable rate for Paris (many hotels increased their rates for New Year). Overall, would say this hotel offers very good value (we paid 155 euro including breakfast) and excellent service. Positives: 1) Service was excellent...helpful before the trip...pleasant welcome on arrival...extremely fast check-in...helpful during the stay (good restaurant tips)...fast check-out. Every request was greeted with a smile. Left chocolates in the room to celebrate the New Year (nice touch). 2) Location...2mins from metro (& start of Champs Elysee). 3) Clean...rooms, while small, were clean. Fresh towels every day as needed. 4) Breakfast...simple but satisfactory. Fresh pastries, bread, etc. Warm welcome. Negatives 1) Not really a negative as value was excellent...but as this is a small (family run?) hotel, the rooms are small (as is the breakfast area). But since we spent very little time there, this was no issue (& it was clean). 2) Rooms have no sound insulation, so you can hear any early morning risers or any vans that might pass by the hotel (if you have a room facing the street). But again, this was a minor point. Overall would say this is an excellent choice if you want something offering great value in a major city like Paris (& providing excellent, friendly service).",

The hotel was nicely located with easy access to the air france buses to and from the airport, as well as to the charles de gaulle etoile metro stop. lots of inexpensive cafes around, including a nice sitdown creperie (ask reception for recommendation). The rooms were large by Paris standards and the bathrooms were spotless. One suite (411) was divided into two smaller rooms, while the other (116) had one large room. Both had sofabeds and so could accomodate an extra adult or a couple of small children. The carpet and sofas were stained (sofa in 116 actually had two wet patches when we arrived) and this was the only true disappointment. Both rooms faced an interior courtyard and were on the corner of their respective floors, so were very quiet. Breakfast was more than sufficient and it was wonderful that this was included ... we could gather around and plan our day while we took it in turns to get ready in the morning. Unlimited supply of fresh hot coffee, good choice of croissants and rolls, and cereal and fresh whole fruit. There is free wifi in the lobby, and while each room has free wired internet, there is no wifi in the rooms, and this was a disappointment for those of us with mobile devices such as ipads and iphones! The staff were extremely friendly, cheerful, and helpful and this really helped make our stay in Paris very pleasant indeed. All said and done, I would recommend this hotel.",

      "text": "Stay here! Stay here! Stay here! Stay here! This stay at the Bradford Elysees was my absolute favorite of all the hotels I stayed in Paris over the years! I discovered this property and other Astotel hotels on TripAdvisor. I kept coming back to the reviews of the Bradford and so glad I did! Our visit to Paris was wonderful because of this hotel and their OUTSTANDING staff. Let me repeat\u2026STAY HERE! I am a frequent traveler and very particular about my travel experiences. I would recommend the Bradford Elysees to anyone who asks for a Paris hotel recommendation. This review is a long one. I apologize, but I feel this hotel and the wonderful staff deserve the recognition. From the minute we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome. Jean Jacques and Serge at the front desk greeted us with a warm welcome. We arrived around 11 a.m. Our room was not ready, but we only had to wait about an hour before we had access to room #19 on the 2nd floor. Serge arranged for us to have some coffee in the beautiful, comfortable lobby after our overnight flight from the U.S. The front desk staff were outstanding our entire stay! Some of the best staff I\u2019ve experienced in my travels. Serge, Claudia, and Christina were terrific. They offered restaurant options, directions, and made us feel welcome each day we returned to the hotel. If more hotels had staff like Serge, Claudia, and Christina, then travel would be so much more enjoyable. They all speak English and go out of their way to make your stay the very best. The breakfast staff were also wonderful. We read many reviews about Laurent and were excited to meet him and experience his great customer service. Unfortunately, he was only working on two of the four mornings we were at the hotel. We were thrilled to have Merkesha (so sorry if this is misspelled) at our other mornings for breakfast. She is WONDERFUL! Room #19 was spotless and comfortable. It was also a larger room for Paris standards. The room had an interior view, which was actually nice and quiet. We kept the windows slightly open and hardly ever heard any street noise or any other noise during the night. The shower is so nice. The bathroom clean and roomier than most small hotels in Paris. The rooms come with a free mini-bar of bottled and sparking water, soda, and orange juice. This was a nice benefit after a busy day in the city. You should make sure to purchase breakfast with your stay. The breakfast is delicious. There is a variety of options. The breakfast staff is hard working and very friendly. They greet you each morning with a smile and get to know you during your stay. The Bradford is an ideal area of the city (8th Arrondissement). The hotel is in a safe area and is a secure hotel during the day and at a night. You feel more like you are in a neighborhood and not in the hustle and bustle of the city. We quickly realized how easy it was to walk to many of the popular sites (i.e. Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde, and some of the other central Paris destinations). The neighborhood is charming and quiet. There are several restaurants nearby, including Les Tontons de Huietieme. We ate here twice. The staff is friendly and have an English menu. The restaurant has good food and drinks. It is clearly a favorite among the locals. We also ate at Le Boetie near the hotel and Le Ponthieu that is on Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt. There are also a couple of small markets close by if you want to purchase some snacks or drinks. You are an easy walk to the Saint-Phillipe-du-Roule Metro stop. You are also not far from a couple of other Metro stations. One of our favorite amenities is the afternoon snacks and the honor bar. The snacks are delicious and offer a wide variety. We did use the Astotel pass and visited the Astotel Opera one afternoon when were in that part of the city. It was nice to have a spot to go to for a brief snack and refreshment. The Astotel is a small, Paris based hotel company and is now my favorite hotel group in Paris because of the amenities and comforts they provide their guests and their professional staff they employ. I know with complete certainty my next trip to Paris will include the Bradford Elysees as my hotel of choice. You should too. You will not be disappointed.",

The staff were always friendly and helpful and the area was relatively quite for Paris. a short walk tot he main strip, even shorter with a short cut through an arcade straight on to the Champs Elysees. The breakfast was also very good value for the range on offer and included both hot and cold options. The rooms were modest by Parisienne standards, not the biggest I have stayed in here and not the smallest though the shower for me was pretty cosy and I am by no means a large guy. The bathroom overall was pretty small and this was my only thing I could fault but they were clean, well looked after and did the job. A great hotel at a great price with only one small negative but worth visiting and staying here again. Thanks.",

The hotel has apparently 52 rooms and it was very quiet with all the restaurants on the streets nearby closed but we discovered that more people joined the area near the reception for a bite to eat as the reception staff advised us that all the nibbles and non-alcoholic drinks were free. Reception: - the staff is very friendly and welcoming and kept our requests for a quiet room on an upper floor. They spoke in English with all the guests who came from all over around - near the tiny reception there is an area where you can sit and watch TV (although I noticed others complained here the mish mash of furniture can be a bit too much) and where there is only one proper table where you can eat if you want to order something proper to eat Negatives: - as we sat at the table to order chicken for me and scallops for my partner (normally we would have eaten at the Chinese or Japanese restaurants we noticed down the road from the hotel) the chef said that we should go to the room and he will bring the food for us!!!! I found it very strange as our room did not have a table for both of us to eat at, plus we would not have liked for the room to smell of food!!! We noticed the chef was rather busy and after a 45 min wait, we finally got our food (which was very disappointing not only because my chicken was 'mutilated' in a way I have never seen before but an end was still raw and also my partner was not impressed with his food either). I ate the salad (as per my pictures) as this was the third place in Paris do disappoint us from culinary point of view and all the Parisian restaurants we ate at during this trip left a very bad impression; plus had to eat in between the little sweets on display available for everyone as the receptionist said. In the meantime 4 more couples came to the reception to eat and I heard the chef telling a couple, again, they have to go to their room in order to wait for the food!!!!! So strange! Room: - room 62, was located on the top floor (and could hear the noise from the room 63 opposite us until they decided to switch off their TV) and because it was right underneath the roof, both the room and the bathroom were at an angle meaning we were both scared not to hit our head on the ceiling!!! Not good. The views over other roof tops was from angled windows, so I was rather disappointed with that. - however both the room and bathroom were very clean, recently decorated, with lots of towels and 2 bathrobes; plus kettle and tea accessories, free drinks in the fridge, large screen TV with lots of channels in several languages (as my pictures show) etc Negatives: - we tried to put the heat on and it did not work: as I was falling asleep due the busy day I woke up in the middle of the night to realise the heating did not work and I was still in the bath robe as it was so cold. The covers were very thin and no blankets in the wardrobe. Also the bath was good although very narrow (I am not big but even I could not 'swing' around when sat in the bath trying to relax my feet after a very long day) Conclusion: honestly speaking, due to the huge mess with the room, plus the terrible food that could have left me sick with salmonella if I was not to notice the small pink side on my chicken I was inclined to give this hotel 1 star, having falling down from the initial 5 star interaction with the lovely reception team. What really saved the rating was the fact that thankfully I did not get sick and the fact that our room cleaner was so honest. In the rush to leave the next morning, my dear partner missed completely an important piece of jewellery and only realised mid day as we were eating in St Germain, in another culinary catastrophe. He called the hotel as we were back in London and upon their confirmation of having the jewellery in their possession, they charged his credit card in order to send it to UK by post (we are still waiting for it though as the reception did not follow his instruction on how to write the address correctly), although even for our stay they charged us twice (making his credit card further un-usable in Paris because of this); they refunded him back the double hotel charge some 5 days later after our departure!!! Great location and reception staff but clearly there are some problems that need sorting out by the management relating to food, heating and double charge.",

      "title": "Stop Your Paris Hotel Research Now! Stay Here at the Bradford Elysees. Wonderful Paris Hotel with Terrific Staff.",
      "text": "Stay here! Stay here! Stay here! Stay here! This stay at the Bradford Elysees was my absolute favorite of all the hotels I stayed in Paris over the years! I discovered this property and other Astotel hotels on TripAdvisor. I kept coming back to the reviews of the Bradford and so glad I did! Our visit to Paris was wonderful because of this hotel and their OUTSTANDING staff. Let me repeat\u2026STAY HERE! I am a frequent traveler and very particular about my travel experiences. I would recommend the Bradford Elysees to anyone who asks for a Paris hotel recommendation. This review is a long one. I apologize, but I feel this hotel and the wonderful staff deserve the recognition. From the minute we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome. Jean Jacques and Serge at the front desk greeted us with a warm welcome. We arrived around 11 a.m. Our room was not ready, but we only had to wait about an hour before we had access to room #19 on the 2nd floor. Serge arranged for us to have some coffee in the beautiful, comfortable lobby after our overnight flight from the U.S. The front desk staff were outstanding our entire stay! Some of the best staff I\u2019ve experienced in my travels. Serge, Claudia, and Christina were terrific. They offered restaurant options, directions, and made us feel welcome each day we returned to the hotel. If more hotels had staff like Serge, Claudia, and Christina, then travel would be so much more enjoyable. They all speak English and go out of their way to make your stay the very best. The breakfast staff were also wonderful. We read many reviews about Laurent and were excited to meet him and experience his great customer service. Unfortunately, he was only working on two of the four mornings we were at the hotel. We were thrilled to have Merkesha (so sorry if this is misspelled) at our other mornings for breakfast. She is WONDERFUL! Room #19 was spotless and comfortable. It was also a larger room for Paris standards. The room had an interior view, which was actually nice and quiet. We kept the windows slightly open and hardly ever heard any street noise or any other noise during the night. The shower is so nice. The bathroom clean and roomier than most small hotels in Paris. The rooms come with a free mini-bar of bottled and sparking water, soda, and orange juice. This was a nice benefit after a busy day in the city. You should make sure to purchase breakfast with your stay. The breakfast is delicious. There is a variety of options. The breakfast staff is hard working and very friendly. They greet you each morning with a smile and get to know you during your stay. The Bradford is an ideal area of the city (8th Arrondissement). The hotel is in a safe area and is a secure hotel during the day and at a night. You feel more like you are in a neighborhood and not in the hustle and bustle of the city. We quickly realized how easy it was to walk to many of the popular sites (i.e. Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde, and some of the other central Paris destinations). The neighborhood is charming and quiet. There are several restaurants nearby, including Les Tontons de Huietieme. We ate here twice. The staff is friendly and have an English menu. The restaurant has good food and drinks. It is clearly a favorite among the locals. We also ate at Le Boetie near the hotel and Le Ponthieu that is on Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt. There are also a couple of small markets close by if you want to purchase some snacks or drinks. You are an easy walk to the Saint-Phillipe-du-Roule Metro stop. You are also not far from a couple of other Metro stations. One of our favorite amenities is the afternoon snacks and the honor bar. The snacks are delicious and offer a wide variety. We did use the Astotel pass and visited the Astotel Opera one afternoon when were in that part of the city. It was nice to have a spot to go to for a brief snack and refreshment. The Astotel is a small, Paris based hotel company and is now my favorite hotel group in Paris because of the amenities and comforts they provide their guests and their professional staff they employ. I know with complete certainty my next trip to Paris will include the Bradford Elysees as my hotel of choice. You should too. You will not be disappointed.",

      "text": "I booked this hotel through Hotels.com for from 3/28/14 through 4/7/14. First of all, I can say that by far this is not a 4 star hotel. Very understaffed, dirty, and even though they claimed hotel being non smoking, my room had unbearable cigarette smoke and burned cigarette butts by the window. It looked like no one even bothered property clean the room. Carpets were dirty, service was very poor. I was locked at the rate through Hotels.com but hotel charged me an extra 750 EU upon my departure claiming they rollaway bed was not fee, even though on the website and at the time of my booking it was clearly stating that there was NO CHARGE for it. The older man at the front desk literally was trying to block me from getting to my taxi, because I refused to sign my card for extra charges. I asked for a wake up call for the morning of my departure, however, no one bothered to do so and when I have confronted the front desk - aka one man, he simply laughed about it and said he might have dialed a wrong number. Wifi is a complete joke - never works and when I have asked for help, they gave me a phone number for tech support in Belgium to call and talk to them - seriously?? This is a 4 star hotel they are claiming to have. We did not have hot water for an entire day since one of the construction crews hit the wrong pipe. Air conditions HUGE vent popped open in our room and dust was all over everything including our personal items and no one even offered any dry cleaning and so on. Staff was not friendly at all, except there was a young gentlemen with a scuffy beard and this poor guy every time was trying to go above and beyond to be helpful. Coffee machine would jam, dishes were dirty with food stuck on them. There is absolutely no insulation, so there is noise all the time, slamming doors, etc, can't get any rest. Anyways, I can just go on and on, but at the end I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone. There are plenty of other hotels with far better service that you can get for the same price if not much less. For something to be advertised as a 4 star hotel, by far this was close to a 2 stars and only because of the location.",

Had a GREAT night sleep every night and room was quiet w/doors and windows closed! Hotel is tucked away in the back about 2 blocks from the Champs Elysees. Metro is a 3 min walk. Good location! Lots of small quick bite eateries nearby along the side streets catered to business workers too.

We had outdoor seating on the balcony, 2 sets of double French doors (including dark curtains if you want to shut out the sunlight), BIG BED!!!!

ASTOTEL TOUR: You can access one of the 16 different Astotel hotels during your stay. They give you a card to use to enter each location and you can enjoy the many beverages, snacks and delicious mini sweet pastry treats while wandering Paris.

OVERALL: 5 out of 5 STARS!!!! Thank you to the Hotel Bradford Elysees staff and especially to Christina and Laurent. You made our 20 year wedding anniversary and first time in Paris trip SO WONDERFUL! We enjoyed the rose petals on our bed and the yummy macarons that greeted us when we checked in the first day.

They claim to have a free high speed internet connection, which is the Basic Business package. This package sees 50KB/s max which is like an edge connection. You are lucky if you get your connection up for 5 minutes; dns fails all the time. Anyway, I got fed up and bought the paid business package which is 17Eu per day. And my speed went up to 100KB/s which is like a joke. Just to browse web pages takes ages, how am I supposed to send out and get emails. Also the connection (not the wi-fi connection) drops every 5 minutes so you have to switch off your wi-fi and then again on to initiate your connection. Yesterday I had no connection at all. I tried all my devices, two iPhones, one ipad, and a macbook air. talked to my colleagues who are staying in here as well, they are having the same problems. My other complaint about this hotel is that neither of our minibars are working. We have informed the reception about our fridges being out of order and still we got hot drinking water and soda. Will never ever come back again.",

      "text": "Booking this hotel was the worst decision ever made and has definitely spoilt our first 2 nights in Paris. Upon arrival, we were informed by front desk that our booking for which full payment was made in advance cannot be found. Was asked to make a fresh booking and of course make payment again for the room. We objected to it as we have already made full payment in advance and requested the front desk to check again. But we were taken aback when the front desk rudely shouted at us to sit at the side and that she doesn't want to talk to us. Finally the front desk managed to find our booking and checked in for us with no apology offered for the blunder of not being able to find our booking and the shouting episode earlier. This is totally unacceptable of any hotel in any part of the world. As we checked into our room, we were satisfied with the furnishings and bathroom. The hotel is pretty much close to champs elysees. However, the nightmare only begins at night. We were kept awake the whole night by the continuous cars honking and groups of people shouting on the streets. It felt as though we were sleeping by the roadside. The noise continued until at least 3-4am. Same thing happened on the second night. We were glad to check out from this hotel and moved on to the Intercontinental Hotel which was way better with superior service. All in all, I will definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone because of the rude staff and unbearable noise at night.",

      "title": "A Lovely City Hotel in a Perfect Location!",
      "text": "Intro We decided to spend a relaxing week within walking distance of the Louvre, d\u2019Orsay, the Orangerie and the Rodin museums, and this hotel has the perfect location. We would like to thank the manager, Mr. Perrin, and his fine staff for a memorable stay. The concierges, Olivier, David and Xavier, made our stay even better. Size and quality of the rooms Many reviews have mentioned the size of the rooms; we found them to be typical of other large city hotels. Our first three nights were spent in Room 504 with a small balcony facing Rue Mont Thabor, a quiet street one short block from the Rue di Rivoli and the Tuillierres Gardens. The queen bed was luxurious, and the speedy Internet service was worth 15 E a day to stay in touch with the office. It is a good idea to upgrade to a large room if you can not handle small spaces or if you are accustomed to large spaces and spend a lot of time in the room. Our last four nights were in a larger Room 508, which had a king bed and two double balcony doors facing Rue Alger. My husband had a cold, and it was a great place to spend a good part of the day resting. The selection of TV channels was superb; we enjoyed listening to shows from Dubai and in so many languages. We slipped our iPod into the radio and listened to music each day and read the Wall Street Journal, Herald Tribune and USA Today provided free in the lobby. Many guests have mentioned the fine Bulgari toiletries; we also liked the large, comfortable bath towels and friendly housekeepers who did not knock when we chose to sleep during the day. The room fridges were great for storing jars of yogurt and drinks we purchased at a convenience store about two blocks away on Rue Honore, which was a great place to stroll. Our laptop just fit in the closet safe, where we stored our other valuables when we were out of the room. Hotel facilities The health club/spa downstairs looked wonderful, but we were too tired to use it after so much walking. The After the Rain spa services were inviting but too expensive for our budget at 120E for a one-hour massage. There were free beverages in the lobby and a nice living and reading room for lounging on sofas. The lobby bar was inviting and a good source of glasses of ice for our room. Hotel restaurant Each morning we had breakfast in Pinxo off the lobby; the omelets were tasty, and the selection was wonderful. The fresh sliced kiwi and French yogurt in glass jars were first class. We were spoiled by the fine breakfasts, which were included in our room package. We did not have other meals at the hotel because there are so many highly rated restaurants in the neighborhood. Where to eat nearby We relied on the paperback \u201cGreat Eats in Paris,\u201d and found superb food and service for about 30E per person or less without wine, which usually ran about 15E for a half bottle. Two of our favorites were a block from the hotel, L\u2019Ardoise and Le Souffle. With a large, late breakfast, we found that one other meal a day was more than enough. It was a pleasant way to celebrate our tenth anniversary and my husband\u2019s first trip to Paris. Museums, museums and more museums This location was perfect for walking to museums each day. We did not bother with the Metro or buses, and only took taxis when we had walked too far. We recommend the Teaching Company\u2019s lecture courses on the Louvre and the Impressionists before you visit Paris. They suggest spending only an hour or two looking at a few works of art in each museum in order to avoid burnout. This was a totally different approach from our previous European trips, and it worked superbly. There is too much to see in a week in Paris, so just select a few places and enjoy a small part of them at a relaxed pace. Other sights We enjoyed a day walking to St. Chapelle and Notre Dame and touring the two islands in the Seine. Another day we visited the Arc de Triumphe and walked along the Champs and to the Eiffel Tower. The Peugeot store on the Champs had the latest concept cars and cool tee shirts from the rugby championships the company was sponsoring in Paris this year. The restaurants and shops along Rue Marbeuf are first class. La Fermette de Marbeuf is a jewel not to be missed. Rick Steve\u2019s \u201cParis 2008\u201d came in handy for guiding us through the sights. There is so much to see that we could spend at least another year in Paris and not return to any place twice. We had no problem communicating with our meager 100 word French vocabularies. The neighborhood Welcome to heaven! Besides the unbelievable museums a few minutes away, the Westin, the Ritz, the Meurice and many upscale shops are within a block or two of the Renaissance. W.H. Smith offers English books, and Angelina\u2019s has the world famous hot chocolate. The Tuilleries Gardens are delightful for people watching. Summary If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing vacation in central Paris, this hotel is the best. The room sizes and prices are appropriate for this neighborhood. Marriott has done a fine job decorating and staffing this Renaissance, and we truly enjoyed our stay.",

      "title": "This is the best hotel I've stayed in in Paris",
      "text": "This is a cracking hotel - we'd have no hesitation in going back. VALUE FOR MONEY We spent a week at this hotel (2-9 Jan 2005) as part of a Eurostar package and it was superb and excellent value. Excluding the train cost, it worked out at \u00a3185 per night (roughly 260 Euro). We were given a complimentary upgrade to Deluxe room for the whole stay. If you haven't done so, its worth checking the Eurostar site - we tried to put together a package ourselvbes but didn't get near the price we paid through Eurostar. ROOM AND FACILITIES ETC The hotel is still very new, and so is clean and modern. The room was pleasingly spacious, which is unusual in Paris. The only small gripe was no tea/coffee facility so it was mini bar, your own drinks or nothing. However, the room was generally excellent. The bathroom was also good size, modern and clean. The shower screen tended to leak , as someone else has observed, so hopefully they'll pick that up, but it was a minor worry. Good quality free toileries provided (Bulgari). The hotel has no view to speak of as it is on Rue de Mont Thabor, which is a small road one back from Rue de Rivoli (which runs down the side of the Tuileries). Some rooms face an interior enclosed space, so if you want a view of the street, ask for it. We realised that it was all too easy to see into some of the non-street facing rooms from the corridor accross the enclosed space, so if you want to be totally private, you should bear that in mind. STAFF The staff were also superb. Rarely for France, all of them were polite and friendly, with the porters opening doors if you wafted near them, and the receptionists calling our good morning every day. FOOD I can't comment on the food as we didnt eat in the hotel. LOCATION The location is perfect. The hotel is 2 minutes walk from Place Vendome, Place de la Concorde, and the Tuileries and the Louvre. This means its a bit further to the Eiffel tower and places like Sacre Coere, but frankly there's no way to be close to all of the sites and my view is being next to the Tuileries is the best you can do to cover most of them. Close by there are plenty of eateries, especially if you prefer a coffee and criossant locally instead of the hotel breakfast (which wasn't in our rate, and I think tends not to be in Paris rates - add an extra 26 Euros per person). Shops are also close by , though its perhaps 10 mins walk to the major department stores like Galleries LaFayette and Printemps. But you wont be short of shops if that's your thing. We were initially a bit concerned that there was an Irish pub on the corner of the road opposite the hotel, but there was no noise at all, and it was not a problem. You're also close to several Metro stations. TAXIS We had one bad expereince on the cost of a taxi booked via the hotel. The cost of our taxi from Gare du Nord to the Hotel was under 10 Euros. The return cost nearer 20 Euros, because the taxis clock seemed to run from being called up by the hotel. If you can bear it, try to grab one yoursleves! Have a great time !

      "title": "Quiet hotel with good central location",
      "text": "My wife and I have just returned from a 3 night stay in this hotel. We stayed in a prestige room, for which we paid 380 Euros a night, with breakfast included. The Room ------------ We were initially located room 101 overlooking the street, but because we and they couldn't get into the room safe, we were immediately transferred to room 314, overlooking the central courtyard. The rooms weren't as small as I was expecting given some of the comments in the reviews I'd read before flying out to France, although talking to the receptionists, they did say that some of the prestige rooms were smaller than the others. Room 314 was slightly smaller than room 101, but it had the advantage of a separate shower and bathtub, which room 101 didn't have. Rooms are well appointed, with an LCD style TV, DVD player, \"King sized\" bed, air conditioning, well stocked minibar, iron, good bathroom (but as reported before with frosted glass doors so not maximum privacy) and robes/slippers. The bed was very comfortable as was the bedding, with plenty of pillows. However be aware that in both prestige rooms we saw the King sized beds are in fact 2 single beds with single mattresses pushed together, so not a true King bed. Overall though we liked the room and it was perfect for our needs. I think they're better geared towards tourists than business travellers as the desk was small, but in future we'll choose a smaller room because we don't think, for the little time we spent in our room, that it was worth 380 Euros a night. A few grumbles about the room before I move on .... 1.) The new safe was on the top shelf in a cupboard, and therefore we couldn't see into it without standing on a chair. Clearly roomkeeping hadn't done this either as there were 2 whisky bottles on top of the safe. 2.) Excessive prices of minibar drinks: 6 Euros for a coke. It's pure greed. If my airline can charge me less than 1 Euro for a coke and make a profit, I don't expect a hotel to keep on this sort of nonsense. We therefore spent no money in the hotel on drinks, although I would have quite happily settled into a few cocktails each evening if I didn't feel that I was being ripped off. After all at 360 Euros a night, something we thought was somewhat excessive for the room size, the hotel could and should be generating a great deal of goodwill by offering drinks to hotel guests at much much cheaper rates. 3.) DVD rental. The LCD TV system doesn't offer movies so the hotel offers DVDs for hire for 10 Euros. I think all hotels could generate a great deal of goodwill if they dropped this stupid nonsense of overcharging for in-room movies. The Staff ----------- The staff were all excellent, spoke English well, and were a pleasure to deal with. The Breakfast ----------------- We choser to have our included breakfast in our room, for which there is no additional charge, although you're limited to choosing from the continental menu. So it's the usual selection of French pastries, cereals, and fresh fruit salad, which suited us well. However with the location of many cafes and restaurants in the surrounding area, in the future we'd choose to have breakfast away from the hotel. We can't comment on the breakfast in the restaurant as we didn't eat in there. The Pool and Gym --------------------- Ok well I don't do gyms, but there were about 8 or so pieces of high end equipment. The pool was excellent - small, but usable to exercise in and cool off. The pool has two adjustable underwater jets for those of us who like to exercise against a current. Wonderful! A very classy pool with slate and wooden surroundings. Note that whilst you can turn the jets on or off, they can be very powerful, and so children shouldn't be allowed to use them without supervision. As well as the pool and gym, there's a boiling steam room (the hottest I've ever experienced) and a sauna, plus shower. Location ---------- I agree with everything that everyone else has said about this hotel's location. A quiet street, in a lovely area of Paris, within a short walking distance to great shopping, sight seeing and famous landmarks. This is a perfect part of Paris to stay in. Would we return? --------------------- Probably, if we could get a better rate. For my money, the hotel's location, and the ability to have a swim at the end of a day's walking and shopping, are what will bring me back to this hotel, but as a said, so long as we can secure a better rate!",

      "text": "This is my second review of this wonderful hotel, whose guest service team has made our trip seamless and fabulous. Last year we stayed at the Renaissance for the first time. The hotel is beautifully decorated and built for comfort. The rooms are small by American standards, but normal for European standards. The design of the rooms uses space efficiently. The spa and indoor pool are beautiful. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is spectacular . The location of the hotel is exactly what one would wish for, close to attractions and museums. It is located in the fashion district, so it's a great place for anyone who comes to Paris on a shopping stint. (I love to buy perfumes at the Fragonard store a few blocks from the hotel). Now, to get down to business, the highlight of my stay, was the wonderful guest services provided by the staff at the hotel. If you are a returning guest, it is amazing that the staff make it their business to remember your likes, dislikes, and special needs. In fact, they have weekly meetings. They discuss ways to enhance their guests' experience. For, example, I am Jewish, and my husband and I are sabbath observant. Arrangements were made to heat up our kosher sabbath meal and serve it to us in our room. We were provided with a table with a white tablecloth and napkins. This helped to make our sabbath so special. Everyone from the guest services team treated us like valued friends. Upon arrival, at 8am, Vikash welcomed us personally. He actually checked us into the hotel while I remained sitting on the couch in the hotel lobby, I was absolutely exhausted and jet lagged. Since our room wasn't ready so early, Vikash invited us to have breakfast in the restaurant while we waited. When our room was ready, he came to the breakfast buffet to notify us. Now here's where you will see why the guest services are what makes the Renaissence superior to any other hotel that I have stayed in. We had purchased railroad tickets for travel to Marseille. The tickets were accidentally left at home, my husband brought the manifest thinking they were Etickets. At around four o'clock in the afternoon, we got a telephone call to the room. It was Vikash. The hotel guest services had been making calls to the travel services that had issued our tickets(in the US), but we're told that the tickets couldn't be regenerated. They suggested that we go to the train station to speak to the head controller. Vikash called to tell us that he was getting off work, and that he would go with us to the train station since we didn't speak French and would have problems communicating. He went with us to the train station and asked about four different employees finally speaking with the controller, who told us that we would have to purchase new tickets. (Last minute tickets would have cost around $500 for the two of us. When we returned to the hotel we called my son who sent us our tickets via federal express, and Pauline the night time guest services manager kept checking the tracking until we finally received the tickets literally 5 minutes before we had to leave for the train station. I looked for my phone to call my son to tell him that we had the tickets and realized that I had left my purse in a restaurant the evening before. We called the restaurant, but they were closed. Now what to do, I had to travel to Marseille, since I was flying to Israel early next morning. I couldn't wait for the restaurant to open. Once again, Vikash came to our rescue. He went to the restaurant and brought my purse to the hotel where it was stored in the hotel safe.upon my arrival to Marseille, Edgard, the head of guest services called to tell us they had my purse. The last week of our trip, which was really the highlight, we returned to Paris to the Renaissence. It was like coming home. Edgard welcomed us personally, and helped us plan our activities, steering us away from expensive unnecessary tours. David and Steven from the concierge helped us with suggestions and directions and recommendations for kosher restaurants. Before our trip, Marie Caroline worked hard to find us a kosher caterer. She researched tours and prices for me, and pre ordered museum passes. Our nephew, who is working in the Israeli embassy in Paris took us touring. Edgard was nice enough to allow us to invite Danny and his family to visit us and to swim in the pool. The kids had a wonderful time. I can't say enough how much the wonderful team at the Renaissence made our stay so perfect. I will never forget their kindness! Although my nephew has invited us to visit and stay in his beautiful apartment on the Trocadero next summer, I am still planning to spend a few nights at my Paris home away from home so that I can visit my friends at the Renaissence Paris Vendome!",

      "text": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel on our first trip to Paris. We are quite picky with our choices and were very pleased with this hotel. Admitted Trip Advisor junkies, we read all the reviews of this hotel and others in Paris before booking our trip. Our big \"musts\": cleanliness, location, ambiance, and as close to 5 star quality as possible. CLEANLINESS: This hotel was immaculate! Not one complaint. Everything looked and smelled new. The room and bathroom were spotless. LOCATION: tucked just one tiny block off of the Tuilleries Garden entrance on a super quiet street. The Tuilleries Metro stop is maybe a 3 minute walk from the hotel. There are a few bus stops along this route too. There is a small Irish pub just outside, great atmosphere. If you want to be in walking distance of the Louvre, Musee O\u2019rsay, Tuilleries Garden, Place de la Concorde, shopping and your choice of small cafes, this hotel is perfect. AMBIANCE: my husband and I dislike fussy and overly ornate d\u00e9cor. The hotel is beautiful with classic, clean lined furniture and decorations. Not too modern and perfectly comfortable. Huge, ever-changing, flower arrangements add to the elegant feel of the lobby. This small hotel is quiet and pleasant to return to after long days of site seeing. My husband and I rank this hotel with 5 stars. We were treated well, by English speaking staff and had absolutely no issues with this property. We did not utilize the facilities in the hotel. Once we were up, we were out the door and then back after dark\u2026so much to see and do in Paris! Our room was small as most rooms in Europe are. The bed and linens were superior and comfy. Room service food was delicious and quick. I have several photos of hotel, but the .jpeg sizes are too large to upload to this website...too bad. When we return to Paris this hotel will definitely be our first choice!!",

Food and other rates were highly exorbitant, but in common with the area. However, the bed was crap. There was a thin pad over the mattress that felt like I was sleeping on a bag of rags. For the price paid this is simply a disgrace. In addition, it was not one large bag of rags, it was two bags. So my companion and I could not \"get close\" without falling in \"the gap.\" While I am used to minding the gap on the Metro, having to do so in my room was unacceptable. Also, the toilette and shower doors bang loudly against the metal frame and guests around us made no issue of loudly slamming their doors at all hours. Also, I am 6'3\" and my feet not only hung over the poor mattress top, but the bed frame itself. It was not so in the W Opera or the Hyatt in London, so it would appear Europe has access to longer mattresses, but not at the Renaissance. While complaining about a mattress may seem petty, not having a good nights sleep 3 nights in a row has left me with an exceptionally LOW regard for this hotel. Also, internet dropped consistently across all my devices, which was maddening, but they did remove the charge, so I guess that is something. While I know that Marriott properties in general in the US have been on the decline for over a year - as told to me by one of their Sr. hotel managers - it is disappointing to find same here in Paris. I no longer stay at Marriott properties; given a choice I prefer Hyatt and Hilton. I hope the excellent staff are able to find work at other, better hotels, like the W or Mayfair. I cannot recommend this place and strongly suggest you look elsewhere, or at a minimum, check your mattress carefully. I would give 2 stars, but the staff were so nice I cannot blame them so.",

There is an internet cafe not too far from the hotel if you really need to use the internet for a period of time. Great location to fantastic shopping and restaurants galore, not to mention just a stones throw from the Louvre and Tuilleries. Plus, two of my favorite chocolatiers are right around the corner.

The original room offered was a tiny shoebox with old furniture lumpy mattress (I don't mean antique ) Front desk manageress said it fully booked and cannot change or upgrade . GM of hotel came over promised to assist us find other hotel. The front desk was trying very hard help a middle eastern family find another hotel with connecting rooms - and found them one - unfortunate they did not help us.

The junior suite was much better but obvious we were very disappointed spend our wedding anniversary in this tiny room with small shower/bathroom. Breakfast room small and less choices of food then other Marriotts. Definite better food in Renaissance Arc Triomphe and a more modern hotel. Marriot champs Elyse's has much more professional front desk better food nicer lobby and overall better hotel. Restaurants recommended for a Saturday dinner by concierge were low ranked in trip adviser so we opted choose different one. I asked concierge reserve me a top recommended restaurant but seems it was busy and she had no personal contacts with top restaurants. Not a professional concierge rather a junior person . The Bar is very small and depressing Overall hotel needs be gutted and renovated Staff mostly junior - plus concierge was uncaring. Not a 5 star Hotel service or rooms. Marriott wake up you cannot employ only juniors at front desk of a 5 Star. I stayed many Marriotts where although some of front desk has change the head concierge remains many years and has great contacts - like Marriot Milan or Marriot Frankfurt. They even have the Golden Key proving they fully qualified concierges!! Although the GM was very professional she needs well trained front desk people to assist her.

      "text": "This hotel does have a great location about halfway between Notre Dame and the Louvre. It's located in The Beaubourg/Les Halles area and is only steps away from lots of cafes/bars/restaurants. It's also really close to a metro so you get easily get just about anywhere in Paris. The rooms are very small compared with American hotel rooms but standard for Paris hotel rooms. Our room had plenty of storage space so we weren't tripping over our bags. The rooms are spotlessly clean and we had no smoking odours in our room. However, the location of the Hotel is very busy and our room experienced a lot of street noise - people talking, cars, sirens etc. Maybe lighter sleepers should request a higher floor or one at the back of the building. The bathroom is nice but small - especially the shower - there was no bath. Hotel staff are quite friendly and helpful. The place does have the world's smallest lift - not for the claustrophobic. We had the breakfast one day for convenience and it is a bit pricy at Eur 14 however if you have a big appetite and like to nibble on a few different things then it may suit you well - they have sausage, scrambled eggs, bread, ham, cheese, yogurts, fruit etc. They'll also do boiled eggs for you as well. There's plenty other places in Paris where you'd pay the same for much less food. One previous reviewer said the area was a bit seedy but I didn't find this. We went to a couple of different restaurants in the area which were wihin easy walking distance and found them really good value. We particularly enjoyed Au Pied Du Cochon near St Eustache which is a bit more pricy but good for a special occasion. Cafe Beaubourg on Rue Quincampoix was really excellent value and good food. I would not recommend the mussels at Le Trappiste which is just round the corner - they weren't very good. If we returned to Paris we would consider staying here again - I thought it was good value for the location. Alternatively I would look for other hotels in the same area.",

The rooms are tiny, but they are beautifully put together. You won't want for anything. There's even a small kettle for tea and coffee. And the location is an A+. You'll be a couple of blocks from the Louvre, a block from the Seine, 5 minutes walk from Saint Chapelle and Notre Dame, close to the Marias and the Pompidou and 1/2 block from Chatelet which is a metro hub.

      "text": "My wife and I stayed at the hotel in May 2006 with our baby son (who is just seven months old). Without doubt, this is an excellent place to stay. Everybody was so hospitable there. They went out of the way to help us on several occasions e.g. restaurant bookings, airport shuttle bookings, luggage storage for a couple of days out-of-Paris journey. They even arranged a luggage carton for us and a packing tape. The Hotel First of all it is not a luxury hotel and may not appeal to those who are used to five and four stars. It is a small 'boutique' hotel, which is charming and very well run. Staff will spoil you with their positive attitude and hospitality. They are fluent in English. Once inside the hotel, you will find the lobby area and especially the library room (or waiting room whatever you may call it) cozy and aesthetically decorated. Hotel offers free maps of Metro, Bus & RER. Get the one which has a 10% discount card of Printemps and keep it for shopping at the departmental store. Herald Tribune is available at the reception. CNN and BBC are available in the room. Room We booked their superior room, which was larger than the normal double bed room and had a bathtub + shower combination. It was a good decision & well worth the extra Euros. The bed was perfect (king size) and the mattress was comfortable. The room was of an appropriate size (not small but was not big either). Baby crib was comfortably placed in the room. There was sufficient space in the cupboard and around the room corners to accommodate our 4 pieces of luggage (2 large sized suite cases and two cabin sized bags). Even after all these things had consumed room space, we could still navigate within the room and on its sides. The rooms are spotlessly clean and very well decorated. They are definitely cute and appear exactly as shown on the hotel web-site. The wash room is lovely, it is very very clean and comfortably sized. Location The location is central & very safe. Chatelet Metro Station is just round the corner (it is one of the major tube stations and several lines pass through it including the one to Disney). Versailles RER is across the river, past the island. Taxi stand is also close by. Key tourist sites are within walking distance (Notre Dame, Louvre, Orsay etc). Several bus stops are nearby. Just behind the hotel is Rue de Rivoli, which has several stores and boutiques. McDonald fans can also eat 'Maxi Menus' on this road, hardly 1 minute walk from the hotel. There were three French restaurants nearby, which seemed good as they were full with people at the dinner time (unfortunately we could not eat in any of these places). We came late in the evenings (around midnight) and always felt safe, both on foot and on metro. Breakfast Yes it is expensive at Euro 14 a person but it is delicious. Different varieties of Cheese, juices, scrambled egg, breads of various sorts, croissants including the chocolate filled ones, ham, sausages, mixed fruits, tea, coffee, milk etc. It is a highly nutritious buffet breakfast which powers one for the whole day of sightseeing. Alternately there is a bakery round the corner as well (however we did not try it). Child Friendly We found the hotel to be very child friendly. We asked for a quite room and got it. The outside view was not good, but you are not in Paris to stay in the room and look out of the window. It was a compromise which we had to make (i.e. between a room with a view and a quite room) and we made the correct choice. The baby slept tight every night. The hotel has given an electric point in all rooms so one can easily use the electric sterilizer. Our sterilizer needed a microwave oven and the hotel had one. It was made available to us everyday with a smile. We brought our stroller along, parked it daily in the hotel luggage room and took it out whenever needed.",

      "text": "I made my first visit to Paris during the second week of October, and had booked my 5 night stay at the Hotel Britannique because of the great reviews here. I was so pleased to discover they were all accurate! From the location to the rooms to the staff, there was not a thing I'd have changed. First the staff: If you're lucky enough to deal with Nicole or Alexandra at the front desk, your stay will be extra pleasant. All of the staff were lovely, from the ladies in the breakfast room to the housekeeping staff, but those two young ladies were such an enormous help with my daily queries about local sights and booking me taxis when needed that they deserved special mention! ~ The rooms: Exactly as the photos show. Small but not uncomfortably so by any means. My room (#62, top floor, and I could see the Eiffel Tower whilst laying on my bed whenever I opened my window!) was very clean, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom was spotless with a nice little glass shower enclosure. (There are also rooms with soaking tubs, so if you have a preference be sure to mention it when you're booking.) There's a minibar in case of midnight thirst, too. The wifi signal is strong and I had no trouble accessing it from the seventh floor. There was a small air conditioning unit above the door, which didn't do a whole lot to keep the room cool in the unseasonably warm autumn days, but because the room had two large windows that opened wide it was quite pleasant. The blackout blinds on the windows were a nice touch while I was trying to quell my jetlag, too! Leaving your key at the front desk when you venture out each day gives housekeeping a heads up that they should visit your room (there's also the standard sign for the doorknob that accomplishes the same thing, of course, but it's nice to not have to worry about losing your key while you're out and about) & I came back to fresh towels and new packets of coffee every afternoon. ~ The location: Absolutely wonderful. There's a taxi stand not even a block away (you can't hail cabs in Paris, so that's a big convenience!), and the Chatelet Metro station is maybe a four minute walk from the front steps. You can get anywhere from there. There are lots of places to eat in the immediate area, too, no matter what you're in the mood for. There are nice little cafes and bistros directly across the street, and several boulangeries and patisseries just around the corner. There's even a small, family-owned pizza joint at the end of Avenue Victoria that I visited a couple of times to grab something quick and take it back to my room; their pizza is delicious and perfect for a simple meal, and the owners and staff are very friendly, even to someone who speaks barely passable French! ~ The breakfast: I'd heard from friends that getting a proper breakfast at most Parisian hotels is a task, and that coffee and a croissant is what to expect. Not at the Britannique! Their breakfast room is lovely and quiet, and there's plenty to choose from in terms of food: fruit and cheese platters, pastries, cold cuts, scrambled eggs, various juices and cold cereals, hot oatmeal, coffee, tea, you name it. Everything was fresh and the surroundings were very clean. I'm not a morning person so I didn't initially request breakfast to be included in my costs, but when I changed my mind on my first full day there it was very easy to just give my room number to the friendly woman working in the dining room and have it added to my final bill. I believe it was about 12 euros per day, which, given the selection and the atmosphere (and the ease!), was very reasonable. I highly recommend striking up conversation with any guests who seem open to it; I met a lot of really lovely fellow travellers while there, and I'm not the sort who usually talks much in the morning! (Same goes for the very pretty lounge; whether you're just down there to relax and read or you've ordered yourself a drink, you can choose how solitary or social you feel like being just by where you sit. It's so nice!) ~ Overall: Simply fantastic. The hotel experience really enhanced my first foray into France, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. Even if you're insecure about your French, never fear: the staff I dealt with were all exceptionally good English speakers, but more importantly they indulged my earnest attempts to speak the proper language and I was always understood perfectly well. (I found that to be true everywhere I went, really. Trying your best to speak French in Paris does count for something!) Truly one of the loveliest places I've stayed, and I can't wait to have an excuse to go back. I don't know why I'd ever want to stay elsewhere now that I know about this gem of a place. **NOTES for the especially discerning traveller/people with mobility issues**: - If you're a light sleeper, you might want to request a room at the rear of the hotel. Mine faced the main avenue, and while the view was gorgeous, it was quite noisy between the sirens, demonstrations at a nearby square, and the streetfront cafes right across from the hotel that had patrons well into the wee hours every night! That said, if it's cool enough to keep the windows closed, the noise is significantly reduced. Also, the top floor is very quiet all day and all night from within the hotel (I scarcely heard housekeeping even on days that I slept in, and the lift doesn't make much noise at all, plus there are only a half dozen rooms on each floor which makes for a calm and quiet atmosphere), so I'd highly recommend staying up there if you're jetlagged! - If you have any mobility issues, do make sure you ask for a room with the shower rather than the big tubs. I have issues with my legs, and I really liked being able to just walk right into the shower, rather than venturing into a giant bathtub, after every day of long walks. I had a peek at another guest's bathroom when we opted to go for breakfast together, and while her bathroom was quite a bit bigger (her room faced the rear) I could see the tub was rather deep. Just be aware and request whatever suits your fancy. There is a lift within the hotel, so stairs won't be an issue (aside from the three or four steps you'd take to get down into the lounge/breakfast room). - As mentioned, cabs are pretty much impossible to simply flag down in the street like in Toronto or New York, so if you need a taxi, try the nearby taxi stand first. Failing that, the desk staff will absolutely summon one for you, but be aware that the metre starts running from the time they're dispatched, not the time you get in, so it runs a bit more expensive to get one that way. Well worth it if you're hauling luggage, but if time and mobility aren't issues, best to walk down the block and catch one there. - A lot of Metro stations seem to either be lacking a lift or the one that's present is out of service. If stairs are hard for you, I'd recommend taking taxis, or at least trying to find out which Metro stations have the best accessibility options. Paris isn't the most disability-friendly city I've visited, but there are thankfully ways around a lot of it if you ask ahead of time. - If you're up for walking, the Louvre is very nearby, maybe a ten minute stroll (and again, this is coming from someone who finds walking somewhat painful, so if I can say it's pretty easy, it mustn't be too bad!). Walking to the Viator office for any tours you might want to take (I recommend the Seine river cruise and the coach tour afterwards) isn't terribly far, either - 15 or twenty minutes along Rue de Rivoli. The desk staff have lots of useful maps, including one to help navigate the Metro, so it's easy to find your way around, particularly to the most common tourist attractions. - If you don't want to incur roaming charges and therefore need a mobile phone just for SMS and local calls, stop in at the Orange shop a couple of blocks away from the hotel. The fellows in there were a big help in getting me a simple phone (for under 35 euros) complete with a calling/international texting plan that worked for exactly what I needed while I was there. Again, I managed to pull it off with somewhat mangled French, so don't feel intimidated. I hope some part of that long missive is helpful to someone! :)",

      "text": "My wife and I staid in Paris for 6 nights (from August 30 till September 5). One cannot have a better location to stay in Paris. The hotel is perfectly located for the tourists planning to get knowing Paris, especially by walking. Many Paris' beautiful places and museums are at the walking distance from the hotel: Ile De La Site, Ile De Saint Louis, Jardin Du Luxembourg, Jardin Des Tuileries, Notre Dame, Latin Quater, and many many others. We even waked to the Alexander III Bridge (Place of Invalides) - about 40 minutes one way, to the Arc de Triomphe - about one hour along the Champs-Elysees, and to the Eiffel Tower - about 1.5 hour along Seine River. Service is very good, rooms are clean. We had one unfortunate incident with somebody's dirty stocks appearing on the night table. After I brought it to reception's attention, management had sincerely apologized to me and offered a complementary breakfast. Also - for some strange reason, they do not provide the shower caps, so plan on having it with you. The hotel offers the complementary WiFi connection - worked fine, and I was able to read the news on the WEB and to check my e-mails. The room (#32 - street exposure, no balcony) was great - small, with the king size bed, and very cozy and clean. Two huge windows can be wide open allowing fresh air in. If you are planning on having several electronic gadgets as I had with me, get ready to take with you the power cord, - there is not enough power wall outlets in the room. And, obviously don't forget a few 220v European power outlet adapters (I had 5 with me - used them all for my camcorder, photo camera, GPS, and two cell phones). The room has a safe with the code lock, it was working fine, so I used it for some of my valuables and purchases I have made. It was not trivial to understand how to use the lock, so I had to figure out it myself and only then I found a small sheet with the instructions on the table. Bathroom is a bit small, but still convenient and very clean. Towels are changed every day. After you check in, you may want to ask them for some more soap bars, as we had only one prepared in the bathroom, and bar us really small. There is an air-conditioner in the room - located just above the entrance door with the regulator on the wall. It's cooling the room sufficiently. We had a chance to try it it for the couple of days while the days in Paris were quite hot (up to 30 degrees Celsius). Breakfast, the hotel provides, is not extremely good. Despite the price for the buffet type of breakfast (15 euro per person), I could not persuade myself to eat it. We tried several various places to eat in Paris (breakfast and dinner alike), even using the hints from the well known \"Tom's Guide to Paris\", and we found the best to be the \"Zimmerman\" restaurant just across the street from the hotel. Breakfast for two: two omelets (one - with bacon), one big vegetable salad, two coffees, and three small croissants - all cost about 35 euro. The weather was not very good for the last three days of our stay - clouds and rain. I regretted I did not take a sweater and a raincoat with me. All in all, it was a great, unforgettable stay in Paris, we very much enjoyed, in large part due to the hotel we chose to stay in.",

      "text": "The hotel is a good choice and a five star rating for the following reasons: 1) The rooms are very nice. I am staying in the room now and will be here for 8 days. Previous reviews talk about the room being small. By American standards yes, by French standards, the rooms are normal. We have a king size bed, refrigerator, desk, a nice Toshiba LCD flatscreen TV, a well sized bathroom, ample closet space and managed to stack three suitcases on top of each other to get them out of the way. The rooms have tall ceilings and windows. More importantly, the rooms have air conditioning which can be important in the summer. Take note: all king sized beds are not the same size in Europe. You have to check the size. At the hotel Britannique, the king size bed is the same size as in the United States. The bed is as comfortable as the Westin beds. I liked the Westin beds so much, I bought one. Usually, hotel beds are not as comfortable as my bed at home. This one is and that is a big deal. After traveling form the USA and fighting jet lag, you will enjoy a great night\u2019s sleep. 2) There are multiple restaurants, shops and a metro stop (Chatelet) which is close by. You are a half block from Rivoli Street. Notre Dame was a short walk. The Louvre and Musee D\u2019Orsay is two stops (on the Metro) away. There is a grocery store two blocks away. The location is great. I analyzed several hotels based on a king bed, air conditioning, location and the tradeoff of price. This hotel was my first choice and from staying here, I can attest to this being a good choice. 3) Service. Here is my observation of Paris in general. A) Make an attempt to say Bonjour or Bonjour, ca va (how are you). If you do not jump in to your issue but take the time to establish a greeting, the Parisians are more receptive. Also, don\u2019t crowd their space. They like to have 2-3 feet of space. OK, having said this, I found the people at the front desk to be accommodating where they can. When I asked for directions to something, they looked it up on the computer, gave me a printout or carefully explained how to get there. I found the service to be very good. 4) Hint: if you book a bed with a certain bed, you will be guaranteed that room. If you want a room on a specific floor or if you want a balcony (those rooms are limited) you need to book (and get a reservation) for that specific room number. If they do not assign you a room number in advance, you are not likely to get your preference for a balcony or particular view. 5) In terms of price, I thought it was in line with hotels offering similar amenities. The hotel provides free WiFi. This was a big deal for me as I brought my iPhone and my laptop. I used the WiFi every day. 6) The romance package \u2013 Yes: If you are considering the romance package and are not quite certain, I would do it. We did. First, we came into the room and there were rose petals in the shape of a heart on the pillows and bed. There were rose petals on the sink, night stands and tray of fruit. A nice presentation and a welcome sight after traveling for a day. The fruit tray was fresh and we enjoyed not having to \u201clook\u201d for fruit on the first day. The package includes a small tin of chocolate and a half bottle of champagne. Both were very good. This was a nice 7) Some people talked about noise from across the street. We face the street on the third floor and there are three restaurants across the street. Most people in Paris take their dinner between 8-11 PM. So, there is noise when the windows are open. However, when we close the windows and turn on the air conditioning, I cannot hear any of the noise. This is even more important in the morning when the traffic begins and I want to sleep in while I adjust to the new time zone. 8) All in all, I highly recommend this hotel for the reasons listed above. I have been to Paris four times and this is my first time at the Hotel Britannique. I will stay here again on my next trip to Paris.",

Downside of the internet was that you had to use a long-randomly generated password given to you from the front desk, and their router kills your connection with inactivity so if you use your mobile phone to connect to the wifi, it'll drop out if you don't use the internet for a few minutes and you have to log back in with a long annoying password. Front desk however had no problems giving us multiple passwords since we had 3 devices (laptop, 2 cellphones). Bed was comfortable. View from the miniterrace was really nice. We really enjoyed the romantic package and thought it was worth it with the half-sized champagne, wonderful heart-shaped container of chocolates, and rose petals/flowers scattered in the room/showers. Scented candles were also placed around as was a nice basket of fruit. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary (4th!) there and had informed the hotel staff at time of booking, and there was a wonderful 'congraulations/happy anniversary' card waiting for us with our romantic package, but the card had a picture of a woman and man kissing in front of a Paris montage which we found humourous given that we are a same-sex male couple. Not totally their fault as I didn't go out of my way to point that out during booking (despite our names being James and Geoff), but given their proximity to the Marais (gay) district I'd suggest they should use genderless congratulation cards instead (ie. cards without photos of couples) to cover all their bases. Location was fantastic - right across the street from the Chatalet-Les-Halles metro stop, and walking distance to the Louvre, Notre Dame, and Marais district (the main gay village). Breakfast was also wonderful - good plentiful supply of hot and cold foods, cheeses, espresso machine with I think 12 different types of insertable espresso coffee picks. The hotel's front door is locked at night and one night we got home late and had to ring the bell. The only downside of the hotel was that I found myself wishing I had access to some sort of gym or workout room. We had brought our own pushup bars but cold barely find any floor-space to use them. Would we stay here again? Probably. But if we could find a discounted rate that was similar to Hotel Britannique's at one of the large chains (ie. W, Intercontinental) I think we might consider giving that a try as well.",

      "text": "When vacationing, I usually enjoy staying at a modern, large hotel with many ammenities. However, while planning a trip to Paris for my 25th wedding anniversary, I wanted a hotel that offered a central location which allowed getting to and from main attractions with ease. Having a few doubts, I reserved the Hotel Brittanique for six nights after reading the many fine reviews on this site. I am happy to say, I was quite pleased with the hotel and its staff. Travelling to Europe occassionally, I found the room size to be typical. Hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff was helpful. I found it odd that the front desk only supplies guests with one room key and that they request the key to be turned in at the front desk each time you leave the hotel. The front desk did mention that rooms were cleaned each day, but if you decide to sleep in and post a \"Do Not Disturb\" notice on your door, rooms probably would not be cleaned after 2pm. Imagine our surprise one day after sleeping in and not leaving the room until 3pm that upon return, our room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided--having not said anything to the staff of our late departure. That is the type of service this hotel provides. It is located extremely close to many restaurants, cafes, bars, metro and major sites. Yes, there was construction being done on the facade of the hotel, however, it did not pose a problem for us even though we had a room located in the front of the hotel with a balcony. Most days we were out of the hotel before the work began and had no problems with the work crew. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay again on my next visit to Paris.",

      "text": "What to Wear and Bring: Don't stress about trying to be a Fashionista like I did. lol. Go Basic. Classy over sassy. Umbrella, yes. However, I only used it once. And also, you can buy it every local souvenir shop. Scarves, yes. It is not as cold as Canada, but it is chilly. You can also buy souvenir scarves everywhere. I read somewhere that wearing running shoes is a faux pas. I saw lots of tourists wearing them. lol. So, unless you want to stand out as a tourist for potential theives, maybe it is best to find an alternative comfortable shoes. Bring your cameras but wearing them as an accessory might also make you a target for theives. I wore a light jacket and an oversize sweater at night; I felt this was sufficient if worn with a scarf to protect your neck. Covering your legs at least partially with an oversize sweater or longer jacket can be quite useful for those windy nights. I only wore a tuque once and did keep me warm but gave me 'hat head'. I wore ballet flats with bare feet on my first day and while it was comfortable enough; the tall boots I brought was even better for those wet pavements. My rain boots was less comfortable for the long walks. Any boots that cover your feet should be sufficient. I brough gloves but didn't feel the need to really use them. I did wear denim but wore it with blazer and a dressy sweater. Casual Chic look. The shades I brought were Black and Grey...pop of colour in Paris, apparently is not the norm. The classics, the basics is the accepted norm for clothing. Is was much more chilly at night than during the day because of the wind factor. So remember that for your evening walks. I brought a pair of MK sunglasses but didn't really use them. I thought it was useful to bring clothing that had pockets; I had light jackets, for instance, that had multiple pockets to allow me to place cards, money etc in assigned pockets for easy access to deter theives from having an opportunity to steal from me, rifling through my purse while searching for money. i wore a shoulder bag but only had maps and guide books in there in case someone did want to steal my bag. Weather: It rained on my first night but didn't rain the other nights even though it was called for via the weather forecast. It was chilly at night; sunny during the day which can call for sunglasses. Pavement was wet but not so slushy that it required rain boots. Plenty of dry area to alternate your route if you are not wearing rain boots. 2-8 degrees celsius but 'real feel' was more 4ish I think. Although, compared to minus degrees celsius in Canada, the weather was a blessing. Flight: Air France. Left 7pm-ish from Toronto and arrived about 2am but 8am Paris time; 6hrs difference can make you totally jet lagged. Take a lot of expresso to keep you awake; I slept for a good 5-6hours and wasted a good chunk of my first day of a 3 night stay in Paris. Landing, Customs, Luggage took about an hour process. Please note: when you get off, there is an arrow for you to go either left (xtox) or right (xtox) for baggage. It does not indicate x (number) correlates to your destination. So I guessed and turned left and luckily, it was the correct area. If you make the wrong guess, no worries, just walk over to the other area. Paris Shuttle: If you booked a shuttle service, please note that you MUST CALL for pick up. If you go to the information booth, they will direct you to a France Telecom phone where you can dial out for free using the number on your Transfer Voucher. They will tell you to go to a specific Gate Exit, where the next available shuttle will pick you up. The driver will confirm your name; so, do not just jump in to any shuttle van before confirmation. Was ready 9ish...actual pick up was 9:45 am. Had multiple drop off and I was the last one to be dropped off at Citadines Hotel, arriving just after 10:40 am. To take a taxi direct would have been approximately 60 Euros. So, while it was a pain in the butt to take a shuttle; it was more economic. Going back home, you must remember to call 24hrs ahead of time to confirm pick up and time. Have the hotel call for you. When I asked in the morning the girl said I had to do it in my room and will be charged for a local call, which I thought was dumb. She was clearly stressed because she had to handle multiple task as others were lined up for checking out; and she said priority goes to those who were checking out. I stressed about this. And on my last day, I looked around for a France Telecom to make this free call to confirm my booking. Failing to find one, I dredded to find out how much the call would cost as sometimes they charge a ridiculous charge. But I saw that it was not busy and when I asked the guy to call for me, he did not blink before helping me. He booked for me with ease. For international flight, they require pick up 4 hours before your flight. i.e. My flight was 1:45pm and they picked me up at 9:45am...but actually didn\u2019t show up until just after 10am because of traffic. Check In: Check in time is actually 2pm, and arriving earlier at 11am-ish; I was very happy to have gotten a room right away. The check in was a breeze. They ask to photocopy your passport and a credit card in case of incidentals. Front desk associates are bilingual and speak English. Check Out: They ask you to pay 1.50 euro per night\u2019s stay. No biggie. I paid cash. Tip: if you can\u2019t stand taking home change...save it up and use it towards your nightly fee. Oh, and if you check out, you will not have access to Free Wifi as you require a room number to sign up. And so if you check out earlier; your code will become invalid. Killing time while waiting for your shuttle pick up becomes very long without internet. :/ Hotel Room: I was on the fifth floor. View was horrible but I never stayed in the room long enough to really care. Electronics: There was a small but modern TV; no English channels (maybe just 1 but for a brief while). A stereo with a CD player was a available; French radio stations so best to bring your own CDs if you want to listen to your kind of music. Blow Dryer in bathroom; Safe and Iron in the closet. Kitchenette: Stove, dishwasher, microwave, fridge; and included utensils, glasses, and plates. Desk also included. King size bed with two twin beds put together, which made sleeping in the middle somewhat uncomfortable. You need a key card to access the entrance to the hotel, the elevator, and of course your room. You need to keep the card in a slot while you are in the room to allow for electricity to turn on. Using the card for access reinforces the safety issue; however, it can get a bit inconvenient having to always have the card out. And if you lose it, you will need to contact the reception via speaker from outside the hotel. (so no worries about being locked out if you lost your card during your daily trips) However, I am sure there will be a cost associated with replacing your lost card, just like with any other establishments. I did not encounter any issues with losing the card. There is beverage station in the lobby which incredibly helpful in between day trips. I actually never sat down at a cafe to drink coffee once. Lol. All my coffee, cappuccino, expresso, hot chocolate, and tea came from that machine. Saves money and kept me warm in between my walks. Location: Amazing location. It is centrally located to all the top tourist areas. Everything is walking distance; however, how long and how far are a different matter all together. On my first day, I fell asleep for 6 hours and lost the day; and when woke up at 5pm-ish I felt the need to walk around as much as I can, so not to feel I didn\u2019t miss a lot from having slept from jet lag. I was a solo female traveler and was able to walk to the Eiffel Tower at night, during the rain, all by myself. When I look back, I think maybe I was slightly crazy for having to venture out on my own, not knowing the language or the area, alone at night as a female. My intent was not to go to the Eiffel Tower. I just wanted to see what was around the hotel. I was very aware of my surroundings to ensure my safety. TIP: always walk with people around at least 10-15 feet away in front or back; and if they are walking behind you, gage whether or not they are fellow tourists or potential thieves (if so, stop to pretend you are taking pics and let them pass you) Seine River/Pont Neuf: This will be your compass during your stay at Citadines. If you ever get lost, walk towards the River wherever you are and then walk along it asking people where Pont Neuf is. Pont Neuf is the closest bridge to the hotel and so you can ask people where that is without letting them know what hotel you are staying at. If you walk out of the hotel, directly in front of you is the Seine River; slightly to your left is the street lights you need to walk across to get to Pont Neuf. You should explore yourself, but just to give you an idea... RIGHT of the hotel: Facing the Seine River, with your back to hotel, turn right and you will find: 6-15 min walk: Saint Michel Plaza...where you will find the famous Saint Michel Fountain; the Metro station; Main restaurants and souvenir shops; left from Saint Michel, you will see the Notre Dame...cross the street and walk towards it. There you will see other monuments and other shops. If you take the Metro it will be 1.80 euro one trip or 7 euro for a day pass (which i think is cheaper if you want to explore). I only took the metro once for curiousity to get to MontMartre (which I think is an absolute MUST see...the Basillica, Dome, Crypt is there but more importantly the town itself depicts, at least for me, the true \u201cParis\u201d I envision in my head. Cafe facing the central area where artists sketch and sell paintings, etc...this was the only part of Paris I saw that made me feel the city\u2019s charm). By taxi it would cost approximately 10-15 euros the driver said. From Saint Michel, Metro Line 4, you get off at a stop (Barbes Rochechouart) to transfer to Line 2 and get off at Anvers; then you will reach souvenir and cafe shops that lead up to the basilica. There are a lot of stairs to get to the church; but there is a lift that you can ride for under 2 euros i believe. I took the stairs. Also, if you take the Dome tour, be prepared to walk narrow spiral stairs...quite a few of them. Lol. The Dome and Crypt tour combo was 8 euros and pretty worth it for the cheap cost of saying you have seen it. TIP: much like the Toronto subway line, there is a map of all the stops. Pay attention to your destination and the next stop; if you are not going in the direction of your destination, get off and go to the other side of the tracks to ensure you are going to your destination. Going back, I was more alert and before going on the metro I looked for a sign which way the metro was going. But in case you did what I did at the beginning, do not panic; just get off and follow my directions. LEFT SIDE: Where most of the hot spots are: Cross one street lights across to the river; but cross the streets to your left and keep walking and to your right, facing the river, you will see small street shops selling paris posters, souvenirs, locks, etc. The second bridge is the famous PONT DES ARTS bridge where lovers place their locks on. It is borded up because apparently there is so many locks on it that it is beginning to break. There is a new bridge dedicated to the same purpose just after this bridge. TIP: Walking along the Seine can easily navigate you to where you want to go by remembering which bridge is closest to the tourist spot you want to go to. I did not discover this tip until my second day and ended up taking a lot of darker side streets, which honestly amazes me that I was able to survive without dishonest encounters. Pont Neuf: Our Hotel, Citadines Pont Des Arts: Louvre Museum...cross the bridge and keep walking straight through the huge building and eventually you will see the famous Glass pyramids that identifies the Louvre. Pont Carrousel: next one after Pont Des Arts Pont Royal: If you stay on this street to your left is Musee D\u2019Orsay (11 Euros; pass not worth it as it didn\u2019t take too long to get in-20mins, but then again I\u2019m going in February where it is less busy). (As an Art lover, I recommend you go to at least this museum and Louvre-dedicate at least 2 hours to each museum to gain an appreciation for the collection it holds; Louvre (12 euros; pass may be worth it to bypass the line but it wasn\u2019t that bad) is much more overwhelming to see as it is bigger) if you cross this and keep walking straight, on the left you will see a statue of a guy on a horse in the middle of the road...walk towards it after crossing the street and keeping walking straight (not left or right) and maybe 2 or 3 minutes from the lights on your right side, you will find Paris Cityvision Tours on Rue Rivoli street. This is the tour pamphlets you will find at the hotel. If you book a tour, you will have to meet there and be dropped off there. So knowing the location is useful if you don\u2019t want to lose the money you pay upfront at the hotel. (i.e. I paid for the ticket to reserve a spot via the hotel, they give me a voucher to claim at their office to get an actual ticket to board the bus) Hotel guy said it would take only 15 mins...but honestly, it took me longer and I was walking like a champ. My tour started at 7pm but they require you to be there for 6:45pm for the Paris city illumination tour and seine cruise (38 euros). Not knowing the exact location also stressed me out because if I missed the time I lose my money. I left the hotel maybe 6:10pm-ish and I just made it for 6:45pm-ish. You have to factor in the street light changing to green for you to cross in timing as well. But if you don\u2019t want to take the tour, to your left and right on the street are souvenir and regular shops. \u201cPlace de Carrousel\u201d Pont de la concorde: the bridge after another bridge I forget, which is the one after the Pont Royal bridge. If you cross this one, you will find the Place de la Concorde...famous Egyptian monument given to paris as a gift; the fountain, the Roue de Paris Ferris Wheel which you can ride and get a great view of Paris for 10 euros. To the left of that monument you can get a great view from the road of the famous Arc of Triomphe (to see closer, it is located at Charles de Gaulle); to the right of that monument is the famous Jardin des Tuileries which will lead to Arc de Triomphe Carrousel, leading you back to the Louvre. I walked this at night and it was more beautiful during the day as you get to appreciate the gardens more. Pont Alexandre iii: Cross this bridge and you will see Grand Palais; walk a lot further straight and you will reach Champs Elysees, home to great shops in Paris including Louis Vuitton, Burberry, etc. Pont des Invalides: Kind of the 2/3 point to the Eiffel Tower from the hotel (7 bridges away); there are two bridges before reaching Pont Diena, the closest bridge next to the Eiffel Tower. (15.50 euros to climb to the top) I didn\u2019t go because the line up was too long and I didn\u2019t feel the need to go up. There are souvenir shops at the base of the Tower; and Food Truck for fries, Cotton candy, hot beverages, etc. But by the water directly in front of the tower, there are also restaurants and other Food Trucks. To the left and right of the tower are the gardens where you can hang out but because it was February and it was night time; I didn\u2019t really venture out there. Pont de Grenelle: the second bridge after Pont Diena; it is where the statue de la liberte is located. Did you know that the statue of Liberty was done by a French Sculptor? And was a gift to the US from France? That is why they commissioned the same artist to do a smaller version for them to place in paris. The rest you will need to venture on your own to discover new areas of interests. Walking alone as a female, I reached as far as St. Augustin one night thinking it was the Montmartre Basilica. Lol, it was not. I felt only a small discomfort for my safety. TIP: Just remember monuments and buildings to navigate your way back to the hotel. Worst case scenario, cab it back. If not to the hotel, to a well known, well lit area like Saint Michel- Fountain.",

Pont Carrousel: next one after Pont Des Arts Pont Royal: If you stay on this street to your left is Musee D\u2019Orsay (11 Euros; pass not worth it as it didn\u2019t take too long to get in-20mins, but then again I\u2019m going in February where it is less busy). (As an Art lover, I recommend you go to at least this museum and Louvre-dedicate at least 2 hours to each museum to gain an appreciation for the collection it holds; Louvre (12 euros; pass may be worth it to bypass the line but it wasn\u2019t that bad) is much more overwhelming to see as it is bigger) if you cross this and keep walking straight, on the left you will see a statue of a guy on a horse in the middle of the road...walk towards it after crossing the street and keeping walking straight (not left or right) and maybe 2 or 3 minutes from the lights on your right side, you will find Paris Cityvision Tours on Rue Rivoli street. This is the tour pamphlets you will find at the hotel. If you book a tour, you will have to meet there and be dropped off there. So knowing the location is useful if you don\u2019t want to lose the money you pay upfront at the hotel. (i.e. I paid for the ticket to reserve a spot via the hotel, they give me a voucher to claim at their office to get an actual ticket to board the bus) Hotel guy said it would take only 15 mins...but honestly, it took me longer and I was walking like a champ. My tour started at 7pm but they require you to be there for 6:45pm for the Paris city illumination tour and seine cruise (38 euros). Not knowing the exact location also stressed me out because if I missed the time I lose my money. I left the hotel maybe 6:10pm-ish and I just made it for 6:45pm-ish. You have to factor in the street light changing to green for you to cross in timing as well. But if you don\u2019t want to take the tour, to your left and right on the street are souvenir and regular shops. \u201cPlace de Carrousel\u201d Pont de la concorde: the bridge after another bridge I forget, which is the one after the Pont Royal bridge. If you cross this one, you will find the Place de la Concorde...famous Egyptian monument given to paris as a gift; the fountain, the Roue de Paris Ferris Wheel which you can ride and get a great view of Paris for 10 euros. To the left of that monument you can get a great view from the road of the famous Arc of Triomphe (to see closer, it is located at Charles de Gaulle); to the right of that monument is the famous Jardin des Tuileries which will lead to Arc de Triomphe Carrousel, leading you back to the Louvre. I walked this at night and it was more beautiful during the day as you get to appreciate the gardens more. Pont Alexandre iii: Cross this bridge and you will see Grand Palais; walk a lot further straight and you will reach Champs Elysees, home to great shops in Paris including Louis Vuitton, Burberry, etc. Pont des Invalides: Kind of the 2/3 point to the Eiffel Tower from the hotel (7 bridges away); there are two bridges before reaching Pont Diena, the closest bridge next to the Eiffel Tower. (15.50 euros to climb to the top) I didn\u2019t go because the line up was too long and I didn\u2019t feel the need to go up. There are souvenir shops at the base of the Tower; and Food Truck for fries, Cotton candy, hot beverages, etc. But by the water directly in front of the tower, there are also restaurants and other Food Trucks. To the left and right of the tower are the gardens where you can hang out but because it was February and it was night time; I didn\u2019t really venture out there. Pont de Grenelle: the second bridge after Pont Diena; it is where the statue de la liberte is located. Did you know that the statue of Liberty was done by a French Sculptor? And was a gift to the US from France? That is why they commissioned the same artist to do a smaller version for them to place in paris. The rest you will need to venture on your own to discover new areas of interests. Walking alone as a female, I reached as far as St. Augustin one night thinking it was the Montmartre Basilica. Lol, it was not. I felt only a small discomfort for my safety. TIP: Just remember monuments and buildings to navigate your way back to the hotel. Worst case scenario, cab it back. If not to the hotel, to a well known, well lit area like Saint Michel- Fountain.",

      "text": "My booking reference is: 11971B0560823 It is for two rooms at Citadines St Germain des Pres. At the time of my booking there was only 1 standard studio room available so I was forced to book a studio executive - which I was reluctant about as not only was the room more expensive it was also a murphy bed. Unfortunately there was no other option - I will also state that you do not inform me on the website that the room is in a different building - other hotel booking websites do so. Upon arrival I was trying to check in and Gabriela informed me of the two different buildings. I was surprised and simply asked whether or not we could be located in the same building. Now perhaps after a long day of traveling I was a bit short - my party with me said I was not but giving the benefit of the doubt Gabriela informed me not to be angry as it had nothing to do with her and it was my fault that the booking was treated as two separate ones and that I was negligent in my bookings and did not read. In my ire at being implied that I was an idiot I did not even manage to communicate to her that the the booking was not two separate bookings - two separate rooms, two separate confirmations but ONE single itinerary. Unfortunately if I switched to both standard studios I would be forfeiting the 60 Euro difference and of course I didn't want to do that. With all due consideration and fairness the manager did attempt to solve matters by offering breakfast but that is not of a 60 Euro value to me. Nor did he actually help as he was pressuring the whole matter as another couple was trying to book in at the same time who was actually infuriating Gabriela with their last minute request before I was checking in. I believe she redirected her ire at me - we all have those days but I do not appreciate the implication that I was being unreasonable. But at that point I don't believe either one could have helped me gain what I wanted which was rooms on the same level, without forfeiting 60 Euro so I decided to let the matter go. I clarified that the studio executive was not a murphy bed as this would not be good for my mom to which Gabriela said of course you don't get murphy beds in the studio executive as these rooms are of higher quality than the standard studio - imagine my reaction when I opened the door and voila a murphy bed was in the room. Yes the bed was not put away into the wall but it was still a bed that could be put away into the wall and mounted to the wall - this meant that the head of the bed was lower than the foot of the bed which would make for uncomfortable sleeping. So Gabriela lied. Thankfully we had two rooms so we just swapped rooms - but again I was having to adjust to erroneous information presented by your company, first by your website (omission of information regarding the rooms and the location of rooms) and then by Gabriela. By the way, while the rooms were solved for my mom - my brother has spent the last few nights unable to sleep. So I've just spent an extra 60 Euro for a room that is not conducive to slumber. So after two nights of no slumber for my brother, and somewhat relative comfort for my mother and I, it is about halfway through our stay. Knowing that you only clean your property once a week - I had paid for full housekeeping service package for both rooms once during our stay. I fully expected this to occur on Monday, as I know housekeeping is rare on the weekends in Europe and serviced residences in general. When I returned to the room at approximately 3 pm and the room had not been cleaned, I went down to speak with reception and lo and behold it was Gabriela again. I showed her my package as it shows up on the manage bookings page of your website which clearly shows the housekeeping package. She says thats an option and I said yes one that I have included in my package as it shows as a part of my booking. She then asks for payment confirmation - as if I would be lying. I show her the payment confirmation and she says that has no breakdown - again why is the burden of service on me? You are in the hospitality industry, your system should indicate what I have or have not paid for. I now have found the price breakdown but for me theres no point in any housekeeping as I am only here for one more night. Not to mention the issue here isn't me, or the fact that I've paid for services I will no longer receive, but that there was no hospitality offered by Gabriela or the manager at this hotel. I have stayed here two years before at this same property and it was amazing - now this place has deteriorated to the point that I wonder if your other properties are worth residing in. It is not as clean anymore, the amenities are no longer as complete - such as the disposable bath mat that used to be in the comfort corner, or larger drinking glasses. The power plug point is even located in the centre of the headboard! Between the heads of the residents sleeping in the bed. Who has ever heard of such a thing? One day a fire will spark and a guest will be injured. Not to mention the Wifi was never fully operational - I am now posting this through 3G on my phone. I have resided in other properties owned by the Ascott and have even considered investing in properties in the Philippines. Instead I find myself infuriated by your front-facing staff. I booked directly through your website because I know sometimes at third party sites things can be lost in translation - but even on your own website things are lost in translation! Your system must be improved so that the onus of proof is not on the part of the guest. Your staff better trained so that they are not deflecting onto the customer their incapabilities and even if the customer is irritable they should not communicate that they are irritated. And your website more comprehensive - all units that are seine view should be indicated as in a different building that that of the main so that parties such as mine with multiple rooms are well informed. Tomorrow I will bring this all up with the manager and I do hope the matter will be settled to MY satisfaction and not to the hotels, or the employee's convenience as I am the guest and you have taken my money with the understanding of a certain amount of service and care - not for me to be treated badly or for me to be deprived of what I paid for.",

Initially I thought this property would be great \u2014 excellent location near Notre Dame and St. Germain with many eating options nearby and metro/RER only 5 min walk away. Large apartment style rooms with plenty of space, decent condition, comfy beds, kitchenette. What brings this property down is the quality of service. 1. Front office staff, while nice and polite, get overwhelmed during check in/out since only 1 or 2 people are working the front. Several staff, including managers stand around, chatting in the background, when they should be trying to expedite check in and shorten the line. 2. Conflicting information depending upon whom you talk to re rates, etc. Prior to check-in, I received an email stating 1 breakfast free per room per day. On Check-in, the \u201cmanager\u201d who was checking me in, stated specifically all 4 in my family would get free breakfast per day. I made sure to confirm (as did the other family checking in at the same time) and he reiterated yes. On check-out, we were charged for each day, each person. We only ate there 2 days since the food quality/selection was poor (and costs 16 euros per adult). Fortunately, only ate there 2 days. 3. WORST OF ALL - 1 elevator \u201cbroken\u201d for the entire 8 days I was there. NO Apparent ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT, STAFF GAVE EVASIVE ANSWERS. CLIMBING 5 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS EVERY DAY GETS VERY TIRESOME. Hotel staff fill the elevator to go up and down just 1 floor. Even when patrons have suitcases, the staff just stay in the elevator and make them wait. If we saw people trying to get up with their luggage, we\u2019d let them go first and walk several flights of stairs just to get to our room. Unfortunately, can\u2019t recommend based on value \u2014 costs too much to have subpar service.",

No problems, happy with that. After arriving back to our room on our second day, bed had not been made and dirty towels still on floor, I went down and asked for fresh towels. The next day, same thing, bed not made, towels not changed. I also asked for a new box of tissues as ours had finished and I had been sick with the flu. No tissues no clean towels, no bed made. I went down again and asked why our room hadn't been made up, and could I please get some tissues( had been using toilet paper!) the following day room cleaned but no tissues!!! On check out I explained what had happened and they did apologise. We had booked two rooms and the other room was made up every day as explained on check in. This just really annoyed me and to be honest, I shouldn't have to ask for a box of tissues every day for three days!! Other than that, the room was clean, the bathroom was very small, difficult to stand in the bathroom with the door opened. The coffee machine was used regularly and appreciated after being out walking all day. I am going to be back in Paris early next year but I don't think we will book here. Our friends in the other room had no complaints at all, though, so maybe just a one off??",

The staff were very nice and answered all our questions. Felt very secure, you had to use the card for your room to even operate the elevator. The free coffee and hot chocolate was a hit! The Metro entrance to the RER B and C was only a short block away. They let us check in way before the stated check-in time. I would not hesitate to book this hotel again. The only negative was the wifi. After we arrive we are told the wifi only works with Internet Explorer or Safari. (I have neither) My Samsung tablet is Google based and we were completely cut off. Luckily we went to the grocery on Saint Germain Blvd and noticed a McDonalds. It had wifi so I downloaded Safari. After hours of trial and error back at the hotel I figured out a workaround that saved the day. (make sure you know passwords of Facebook and other e-mail accounts) Even with the workaround the internet was very slow. If we had brought our laptop maybe we would not have had a problem?? Don't know. I spent an hour and a half on the lobby computers and it was worse than in the room. Wouldn't work. A young couple were on the lobby computer next to us and were upset they couldn't get anywhere on the internet. They gave up and went back to their room.",

      "text": "We were really looking forward to staying at this hotel with our 6 and 8 year olds and had booked it due to the good reviews on Tripadvisor. We arrived having had a four hour epic journey from Disneyland (which should have taken half an hour but for a broken down train). Our youngest also had a sick bug so not the best start. We arrived at the hotel at 4pm and went to check in (which was stated as from 2pm) slightly on our knees by this point. We had a highly unhelpful gentleman on reception checking us in (I think he was rather annoyed that we didn't speak much French). Having politely requested in advance a high room with a view of the river if possible (per the Tripadvisor suggestions), we were told that these were for club apartments, not the 1 bed apartment that we had booked. A bit disappointing given that our was costing nearly 300 euros a night on a room only basis. The gentleman was quite brusque and said that Tripadvisor was full of wrong information. He then said was that our room wouldn't be ready until at least 5. When we asked if he could possibly find a room that was ready as our son was unwell, he simply reiterated that check-in was only ever from (rather than at) 2pm and they were busy. He said that we could store our luggage, walked over to where my family was sat with my cases and wanted to put them into the store room immediately. Unfortunately we hadn't packed anything so wanted 5 minutes to put some things in a rucksack so that we could go out for a walk. He looked highly irritated and marched back to reception. We sorted ourselves out in five minutes and went back to queue with our cases so they could be stored. He pointedly ignored us for a good twenty minutes and served everybody before and after us. Eventually in desperation I went up to a lady on the reception to ask again if we could drop off our cases. She looked extremely surprised that a room couldn't be found and within a couple of minutes, had found a room for us (and was very friendly and helpful). To be honest, the way we were treated by that one person overshadowed the rest of the stay. Trying to be objective, the apartment was a surprisingly good size with a double bedroom and a sofa bed (which I hadn't realised was two singles but they were comfortable for adults). The apartment was on the first floor and overlooked an internal courtyard. The bedroom slightly bizarrely looked straight onto the reception area and the check in desk (a little ironic..). It was a bit dated and not terribly bright but good overall. Wifi worked really well in our room and was free. The location was great, right opposite the island, and about 5 minutes stroll to the Metro. Loads of lovely places to eat a little south of the hotel. One of the best things about the hotel was the free tea, coffee and hot chocolate machine in reception - great given some of the prices in Paris. The hotel had kindly provided disposable cups with lids so you could take your coffee back to the room. The breakfast looked ok but nothing special so we went out to the cafes. When we returned to the hotel at 4pm on the day of our departure to collect our cases, we had a wry smile as the next batch of customers were trying to check in only to be told that their rooms weren't ready as they were so busy... It's a shame that the check-in process spoiled an otherwise good hotel but for us, it never really recovered after that.",
