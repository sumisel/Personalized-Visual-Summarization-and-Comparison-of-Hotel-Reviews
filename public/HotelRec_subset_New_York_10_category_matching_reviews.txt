      "text": "I've stayed at Hotel Giraffe twice - once for 3 nights over Labor day weekend 2004 and the other for 3 nights around Christmas 2004. I had an extremely pleasant and warm experience both times. Location: As I can't stand the tourist trap that is Times Square, I loved the hotel's midtown location on Park ave. About a 10 minute walk to Grand central (about 12 blocks). Location is close enough by foot, cab, or subway to everything, but enough removed from everything that it wasn't cramped or overly crowded when you walk out the front door. Staff: I found the staff to be extremely warm, polite, and friendly without any air of pretention. They are attentive and helpful, and make you feel welcome while you're there. For example, one night before going to bed, I was in the mood for a glass of wine (at 1 am). Their room service is not 24 hours, but I called downstairs just to ask, and a gentleman was at my door within 5 minutes with it. The fact that the hotel is small and doesn't have many rooms allows for such personalized service. The minibar fridge does have electronic sensors for detecting purchases, so if you move stuff around to put something of your own in there, don't be alarmed if you see a few minibar charges on your bill. These charges were quickly removed without problem when I questioned them at check out. Check in/check out is very fast and smooth. We parked a car one of our stays and it was brought out to us in about 5 mins. On both stays, I stored luggage for a few hours upon check-out, which worked well. Hardly any wait to store/retrieve bags. Staff went out of their way to hail cabs to the airport for us on both stays (once the guy walked up about a block and a half or two from the hotel to hail a cab!). Rooms: My first stay was in a one bedroom suite and second stay was in a deluxe double. I found both to be very comfortable. Soothing, earthy colors and well appointed. Not super modern or hip design, not a totally generic holiday-inny feel, but just nice. Room was clean and maid service was great. We received turndown service most nights with chocolates. Complimentary water bottles in the room. The bathroom does have sort of a frosted door, so if you're not comfortable with that, then be forewarned. Bath products are Natura brand and very pleasant. Sink area has a big marble countertop which allows you to spread out your toiletries nicely. TV is not too new, but does its job, and there's a VCR (but no DVD). Completely fine with me as all I wanted was to check the weather and news on tv. Balcony is a wonderful touch. Although small, allows you to peer out from above to the outside (especially cool if you're on the Park ave side and look at the traffic lights changing sequentially to red or green for a distance of about a half mile or so). Balcony is also great if you're a smoker but don't want a smoking room and don't want to have to go all the way downstairs and outside. Also, there is free wireless high speed throughout the hotel. Lobby: The lobby is well designed, with nearly ceiling to floor windows, which keeps it bright. There is comfortable seating (chairs and sofas). One of the brighest spots about Giraffe has to be the food counter area in the lobby: this is where they serve complimentary continental breakfast (coffee, juice, cappucino, breads, pastries, bagels, hard boiled eggs, cereal, bagels, etc.) in the morning and where they have complimentary wine and cheese on weekday evenings. Although not huge, the breakfast is definitely enough to get you going in the morning. The other wonderful thing here is that 24 hours a day, guests can get complimentary bottled water (as opposed to paying $5-$10 for a bottle of water at other hotels), coffee, tea, and cookies. It's great to be headed out for the day and grab a bottle of water or two, or headed in for the night and grab a bottle of water or two, for free! I did briefly visit the rooftop garden area on my labor day stay - it is small but charming. A very cool giraffe statue there. A few patio tables and chairs for lounging. The hotel is in the 'Curry Hill' area of town, so there are a number of Indian restaurants within a block or two of the hotel (toward Lexington), of which several are South Indian - which is great if you're a vegetarian. Also, Vatan restaurant (Gujurati vegetarian) is about a 10 minute walk from Giraffe and is absolutely awesome if you're vegetarian. Bottom line: This is indeed a small, botique hall. Do not stay here if you want a huge, expansive atrium lobby or are looking for sutffy, old world rooms and service. Also do not stay here if you can't do without the \"hip\"ness of places like the W hotels and other botique hotels. But do stay here if you want a very pleasant experience, clean, comfortable rooms, warm and friendly staff, and a great location. If you are worried about having a subpar hotel experience during your NYC stay, stay here and put your anxiety at ease. The only slightly minor negative is that prices can be a bit on the higher side if you are from out of town, although overall they're not bad for NYC hotel room prices in general. But your money is definitely well spent here which cannot be said for all pricey NYC hotels. I've stayed at about 4 different hotels in NYC and this was by far the best hotel, in terms of comfort, convenience, and overall experience. If you read the reviews on tripadvisor, it is one of the few hotels in NYC that only has a few aberrent negative reviews. Most reviews are very positive and very accurate. I saw that many other 4 or 5 star NYC hotels have such mixed reviews on tripadvisor, that you don't know what you're going to get. But stay here and you will be pleased - Giraffe is gold every time.",

      "text": "We stayed at Hotel Giraffe for 15 nights over xmas and departed on the 30th December in a Suite on the 8th Floor. Hotel Giraffe is a very small hotel, I think around 72 rooms? so did not feel chaotic like some major chains especially at breakfast times. Yes there is only 2 lifts and yes they were slow but you get that. The room was very clean and maintained very well ( and we are very picky so it was acceptable!) We have a 4yr old so the suite was very good, our daughter was able to sleep in the separate lounge with a door that divided the lounge and the main bedroom. Yes the room was a little small compared to what we are used to Australia but it was still a great room. Even on the 8th Floor it did get a bit noisy at times, but that is NYC - a city that never sleeps! Bathroom was an alright size, but maybe the towels could be a little bigger for showering! The location was absolutely fantastic. We found it was in walking distance to most places, and very close to the subway (#6 green line), so getting around was easy and awesome. The hotel is near the Flatiron district, walking distance to Soho and Greenwich, and walking distance to Grand Central Station. The hotel provides free WIFI, continental breakfast and unlimited cheese/nibbles and wine every night complementary with every room. We found the price of the rooms very reasonable considering the location and the cleanliness of the hotel. The hotel does not provide many services like a bigger hotel, but that is how they are keeping the costs down. There is no mini bar, so you can't get hit for extra costs. The continental breakfast, compared to what we are used to in Australia, was not really breakfast. We were expecting hot food, it seemed like it was a lot of pastries and bread products. Cheese and cold meats, or hot food would have been nice. With the service, coming from Australia where we have a very high standard when it comes to customer service, the staff behind the counter, as much as they were very helpful at times, we sometimes felt they were not very sincere and genuine and at times we felt like it was almost condescending. We feel that maybe being in the hospitality business customer service should be something the hotel could and should work on. Hotel Giraffe does organise hotel transfers with an independent company for a flat rate. To the hotel and back to JKF on both occasions was a bit of a schamozzle On the way from JFK we were overcharged which Gaby behind the counter got us a refund towards our trip back to JFK. On departure day when the SUV showed up to take us to JFK, the driver asked us if I had booked a SUV or normal town car because an SUV costs more? So we felt like the right hand was not talking to the left hand!! Our booking was for a town car for both trips so who knows what was going on! So moral of the story confirm with the hotel the cost of the trip and what kind of car they have booked for you and keep your email! Overall - we would likely stay at Hotel Giraffe again, we don't think you will find many places this good for this price range in NYC.",

      "title": "Plus and Minuses",
      "text": "I had reserved a room at the hotel with high hopes/expectations so perhaps this explained the slight disappointment at the overall experience. There are huge pluses that should be acknowledged. It is true what others say about the great continental breakfast on offer in the mornings and the choices of wines and cheese in the evening. The quality of the breakfast and evening drinks is high. I've stayed at other NYC hotels that offer evening drinks but I the options at Hotel Giraffe impressive. They also have coffee, tea and biscuits throughout the day in the hotel lobby. This is great when you pop back into the hotel for a quick rest between shopping trips. The hotel room is small but this is standard for all NYC hotels. I had the basic room with queen bed. It was adequate for single traveler. The room was cosy but there was ample storage space and the bathroom was a decent size. I had enough space for my make-up and other toiletries. More importantly, the room was very clean. Bathroom was spotless, the shower strong, and the bath-tub drained well. The shower curtain was clean and I couldn't spot any mold on the shower curtain. The best part is that the room came with a small balcony so one can envision standing there to look out into the street when the weather permitted this. I was there in winter so it wasn't put to use. The balcony allows for you to get fresh air which can be important. Another plus is of course the location. It is near to many great restaurants and eating places - of all sorts. I spotted Chinese, Indian vegetarian, fusion, american, italian - but this is NYC so you tend to get this anywhere. There is a pharmacy nearby, and you're a few blocks from the Flatron building, empire state building and Times Square. It is not usually in an area I had stayed at before - as I prefer to stay closer to Central Park - but this reas had charm. I found it convenient. So now to the minuses - the rooms were not as soundproof as you would have hoped. You do hear people walking in the hallway, doors opening and closing. If people in the other rooms had been loud you would have heard it. There was also of course noise from the traffic though I was on a slightly higher floor. I have stayed in other NYC hotels that had effectively managed the noise so much so you hear very little of what's going on. This wasn't the case for this hotel. I ended up with ear plugs to make sure I slept through the night. It was fine with the ear plugs. I was, I supposed, most disappointed at the staff manning the front desk. I understood that it was a very busy period at the hotel. They were full. Hence, almost everyone I could see who arrived at anytime before 3pm had to wait for their rooms. Check out time was at 1pm which meant that housekeeping would need time to clear the rooms and clean them. Nevertheless, it was a tad frustrating to be told at 2pm that your room was not ready and that you had to wait. Additionally, the staff wasn't proactive to approach you to let you know that your room was ready. After waiting till 3pm, I finally approached a staff to ask and only then told that the room was ready. Throughout my stay - which was not long - the front desk staff seemed primarily interested in talking to each other. They never acknowledged me or ask about the stay - including at check-out. This was not the service I was expecting. Other staff - from housekeeping, doorman, wait staff handling the breakfast and the evening drinks - were much warmer. They were open to helping when they saw that you needed help. I would like to think that this is a truer reflection of the hotel and its service as opposed to the people manning the front desk. I liked the hotel overall. There are real pluses that would make this hotel a wonderful boutique hotel to rest in when in NYC. It has lovely perks that make it unique. But the minuses on the service take away a little bit of this pleasure.",

      "text": "Stayed here for 3 night to celebrate my birthday. Our room was on the top floor where there is an outside deck. Weather was bad so we did not utilize the area. We Saw some ash trays up there which we assumed meant that they allow smoking which was a bit of a disappointment to us. Our room had a King bed with a small balcony which looked into office space across the street a a slight view of Madison Square Park. However opening the door for air made for too much noise from the street but It it was a nice option. The room also had black out curtains which we appreciated The room was clean with the exception of some carpet staining and the Bed was comfortable and had nice linens and a mattress cover. However, we where disappointed that the mattress and box spring where not encased as an extra measure of assuring a clean bed. Although the bed was very clean!!!! This is just a thing for us when traveling. There was a velvet chair in the room that has seen better days and was faded and worn. I noticed a stain on the seat cushion and turned it over only to find additional stains and some debris on the chair. Why don't the housekeepers vacuum out his chairs?!! Bathroom was a bit dark but was clean and large. Lovely towels and plenty of them. A great closet for luggage etc. Daily happy hour in the lobby from 5-8 was wonderful and included in the price. Nice wines, cheese and fruit wonderfully presented by a gracious hostess. Breakfast in the morning with fresh fruit, pastry, yogurt. All day coffee ( espresso, lattes etc teas, along with fruit The lobby sofas could use a bit of refreshing but otherwise the lobby had nice table and chairs to sit and talk and enjoy the ongoing refreshments. The Hotel is well maintained. The staff was the best and were kind, accommodating and respectful at all times. Overall, we loved this hotel and would recommend to family and friends. Hope to return soon.",

      "title": "Sometimes things aren\u2019t always what they seem...",
      "text": "We just returned home from our stay at Hotel Giraffe yesterday... Upon arrival at Hotel Giraffe, everything seemed wonderful. \u201cSeemed\u201d being the operative word. We had a room on the 11th floor (I had requested a high floor) and a balcony that looked out onto 26th St. (I had also requested the balcony - but on Park Ave. S). The way the hotel is designed the balconies overlooking 26th are a bit pointless. You can't see anything except the office building across the street. We enjoyed the complementary Prosecco in our room (we were celebrating a special occasion) and went on to our dinner reservations nearby. However, the bad things quickly started unfolding from there\u2026 Upon returning for the night, and settling down for bed, we discovered the horror that is the bed, bedding, and pillows of the Hotel Giraffe. The bed was absolutely horrible. I\u2019ve had better mattresses at \u201cComfort Inn-type\u201d hotels and the like. Absolutely ridiculous for a hotel of this caliber to give you a slab of concrete to sleep on. The bedding was simply two sheets with a thin blanket in between. Where are the fluffy duvets that a hotel like this should have? (Particularly in NYC in January, no less). The sheets were cheap as well, and a very low thread count. The pillows that they provide make for a nice looking bed, but are horrible. There were two Euro pillows (large square) in shams, as well as two extremely plump, yet smaller than standard bed size pillows with cases, as the \u201cnormal sleeping pillow\u201d. Neither of these were comfortable - and we seriously considered hitting Bed Bath & Beyond after our first hellish night of sleep at the Hotel Giraffe, to purchase pillows for the remainder of our stay. Even the most basic of crappy pillows there for $10 would have been miles better than anything the Hotel Giraffe offered. We soon learned that they are by far more concerned with their appearance, than by actually being a welcoming, comfortable place to stay. Luckily we had gotten a deal ($185/night) for our 3-night stay. There is no way that this is worth any more than that. The location was fine. However, their address is \u201cPark Ave S\u201d \u2013 which is also misleading. The entrance to the hotel is on 26th street, NOT Park Ave S. Trickery? You betcha. Of course Park Ave sounds better than 26th Street. Just another instance where they care more about appearance. Housekeeping \u2013 On our second day there we returned back to our room around 5pm, to find our balcony door wide open and our belongs strewn about by the wind. In January!!!! When I called the front desk to alert them to this huge blunder, they simply said that \u201chousekeeping must have done it. Sorry\u201d. \u2013 excuse me?!?!?! that\u2019s it? Our room was not serviced on our second day --- housekeeping\u2019s way of punishing us for telling the management that they left our door open??? Who knows? I had to call the front desk and ask for clean towels. At that point, we had given up hope of the hotel coming through for us in any way. Complimentary Breakfast \u2013 Our first morning there, after our horribly uncomfortable night, we headed down to the \u201ccomplimentary European-style breakfast\u201d -- only to find a pathetic spread of cold cereal (nothing European about that) and absolutely no seats to be had. I was in desperate need of some coffee, so we considered staying \u2013 but after hovering around for a few minutes \u2013 with plenty of staff milling about , completely ignoring us \u2013 we headed back upstairs for our coats and out to have breakfast elsewhere. The Bathroom \u2013 The toilet made a whining/organ pipe type noise every time it flushed. Very annoying. The door was wood with a HUGE glass window in it. This doesn\u2019t do much for privacy in a tiny NYC hotel room. There was no fan in the bathroom \u2013 another point against them for a lack of concern for guest\u2019s privacy. Never mind being engulfed by steam during your shower because of lack of ventilation. They make it perfectly clear that they just don\u2019t care. - Tub/shower \u2013 with the shallowest tub I have ever seen. It is a tub in name only. - Claim to have a refrigerator in room \u2013 a mini bar is NOT a refrigerator. (the mini bar was not even remotely cold!). - Kept having to call down for ice for our drinks \u2013 and they took forever to bring it up (This is the only way to get ice here). - No real pillows for sleeping on \u2013 all decorative, and all horrible - Mattress like a slab of concrete - Cheap bedding - Balcony door left open all day (in January!!) - Room not serviced one day, at all - Complimentary breakfast poor, and no room for us anyway. - The doormen (that were OCCASIONALLY at their posts) never offered to hail us a cab, even when it was clear we wanted one. Including several times in the rain! I did a lot of research (as I always do) before booking our stay, and I am very disappointed that TripAdvisor led me astray in this instance. Hotel Giraffe rated number 4 in NYC? I think not!! (they must be paying people off). Needless to say, we will not be back. I advise everyone to stay away. If you must stay here, don\u2019t pay more than $200/night \u2013 you\u2019ll be sorry you did. ~",

      "text": "When they get it right, they REALLY get it right: I stayed at the Hotel Giraffe last week for business and they are getting it right. After consulting TripAdvisor before my stay, i decided to return and add my accolades for this lovely spot. I stay in a lot of hotels and grew up in the hotel business, so I'm always interested to try someplace new. Usually fairly critical, I found NOTHING lacking at this wonderful little haven.This hotel is what the W Hotels in the city purport to be, but for them, it's a strategic concept. At the Hotel Giraffe, it's truly who they are. Hip, intimate, comfortable, welcoming, with flawless service. During my visit I encountered businessmen & women, a cooler-than-cool alternative musician, a shy family from Portugal on holiday, a model on a photoshoot in the lobby, and a young mid-western couple, and miraculously, all seemed to feel completely at home, and in their element. (Generally, I find manhattan hotels cater exclusively towards either a) budget-concerned, fanny-packing tourists, b) impossibly hip scene-sters, see ..., or c) wealthy private-clubbers who fancy themselves \"the elite.\"The Hotel Giraffe is neither a tour-group home-base, nor a pretentious scene, nor does it promote the feeling of snooty exclusivity: this gem of a hotel gets it just right. Intimate elegance, with just enough schwank to make it glamorous, yet with enough comfort to make all feel welcome. The staff has the non-solicitous, honestly friendly service of a small european inn. The rooms are larger than many in New York, but are still petite. Still, they make the most of the space. No detail is spared, from the unexpected fine wood built-ins, to the satin, quilted spread, and the well-appointed bathroom and amenities. The flowered balcony was a much-appreciated bonus.I returned from late nights working to turn-down service with dimmed lights, soft music, rich chocolates and a remote controlled privacy shade already lowered. The lobby breakfast and rooftop garden are perfect for business or pleasure travelers alike. A house laptop, with DSL connection downstairs, kept me from being cooped up in my room answering email. Stayed for the week on business, and it's the first time I ever felt like i was \"going home\" when reaching my hotel at the end of a work day. Marvelous.",

The front desk staff was not particularly helpful. There is no information in the room regarding internet usage, times for breakfast or how to use the health club. The bed was hard and the elevators were frequently slow. This morning, as a large group gathered waiting for an elevator, the front desk people huddled together, not acknowledging the problem. We ended up taking the stairs. When we decided to check out 2 days early, the front desk representative didn't even ask why, but informed us that there was a $100 charge for checking out early. Read what they ask you to sign when you check in because the $100 charge was explained to me as a charge for smoking in the room. We are now at the Eventi, which is not rated as well in TripAdvisor, but is far superior. You would recognize the difference from the moment you walk in the front door and are warmly greeted by the front desk.",

      "title": "Great Location, Large Rooms, Uncomfortable Bed & Circulation",
      "text": "I stayed at the Shelburne Murrary Hill as part of two week business stay (attended training at Cornell ILR's Mgmt. Center on 34th) in Manhattan during January and February of this week. From the Shelburne to Cornell it was about 12 minute walk. While it was cold, it could have colder and there was no snow during my stay in Manhattan. During the two weeks, I stayed at Residence Inn Times (39th & Ave. of Amr.) Square, Affinia Dumont and the Shelburne. I would rate the Residence Inn as being the best in terms of room comfort, quality of staff, and newest facility. Affinia Dumont (34th & Lexington) has comfortable and larger rooms than the Residence Inn and the neighborhood is less hectic and offers more food vendors and eating establishments. The Affinia has the Best Door people in the City. The Shelburne...hm.... I actually walked from the Residence Inn to the Affinia Dumont, pulling two rolling cases. After my stay at the Shelburne, I opted to stay shorter than planned and walked a few blocks Affinia Dumont and offers many eating establishments and food vendors/stores. The check in at the Shelburne was smooth. I asked for a quiet higher floor room away from the streets (Lexington, 38th and/or 37th). So I had a view of other rooms, but my room was quiet. The rooms have very old and dated decor. As mentioned in other reviews the curtains are dirty. My curtain had two hooks off the rails so I climbed on a chair to fix it. The light on my dresser did not work and I mentioned it to the front desk and they never did anything about this. Compared to a recent stay the Residence Inn in Beverly Hills, my night side stand light was inoperable and they fixed it the same day. The Shelburne is one of the newer purchases of the Affinia Group of Hotels and my guess is that they are maximizing their dollars out of the purchase before they have to remodel. The rooms are large for Manhattan standards. But everything is old. The bathroom is small and mostly clean but not as clean as the Affinia Dumont or Residence Inn. There is a small kitchenette which is one of main reasons I stayed here. Typically I eat breakfast and lunch at my business and/or training and want a light or takeout meal at dinner time. So I like to have fridges and microwaves in my room. I found the bed to be uncomortable, almost sagging on one side. Also it was difficult to moderate room temp. Between the Affinia, Residence Inn and the Shelburne. The Shelburne was least comfortable. But, it was the cheapest. I believe I paid advanced booking rate of $149.00. Versus $170.00 - $200 for the Affinia and $190 for the Residence Inn. For $50 - $60.00 more the Affina Dumont is a lot better than the Shelburne. The Affinia is really tall so the higher up the less traffic noise you hear. They have a good gym, offer free fruit, smaller but nicer rooms than the Shelburne. I used the gym in the basement at the Affinia and they were some good equipment in the gym.. I also used the washer and dryer in the basement too. But I think they may have been some leftover bleach in the washer because there were some stains on some of my clothes. There were even some hotel offices in the basement. Hm..not sure if that is good or bad. I tried to onsite restaurant, The Rare. I had their Roquefort Burger and the Sweet Potato fires which were tasty. But at better place for burgers is the Jackson Hole on 3rd between 34th and 35th. Nearby. There are many restaurants nearby, especially on 3rd. I tried Carl's Cheese Steaks, Blockhead Burritos, Imperial Pizza and Brick Oven Pizza. All were okay. All tried a good Chinese Restaurant (next to Italian rest.) on Lexington, between 34th and 33rd. Across from the Chinese Resturant is the Murray Hill Diner which was good for breakfast. This neighborhood of Manhattan is called Murrary Hill. Since there are many Curry restaurants some dub this area as \"Curry Hill.\" Compared to the restaurants near the Residence Inn...Curry Hill has more better choices to choose from. My favorite restaurant in the area is a local chain called the Moonstruck Diner. I went there both for breakfast and dinner. On 3rd between 32 and 31. Also one on 38th and Madison. I also enjoyed tasty Korean takeout in Korean Town, on 32nd between 6th & 7th. at Mandoo Bar. Seoul Garden down the street and the 2nd level is yummy sit down Korean restaurant that features many soups. Quick bites & coffee at the chain Guy & Gallard. Cheap Chinese at Spades on 3rd. Tasty Malaysian food at Maya in Chinatown. During this trip, I tried Deli food at Katz's in the Lower East Side on Houston street. and the Carnegi Deli on Broadway near 55th. I also recent was in Beverly Hills and tried Factor's Deli on West Pico near S. Beverly. After some thought, Carnegi has the tastiest Hot Pastrami! For sundries and tolietries, there is Duane Reade Pharmacy on 34th and 3rd Ave. D'Agostino Markets nearby on 3rd. I found shopping interesting in the Lower East Side and at Bloomies in SOHO which had better deals than Bloomies at Lexington and 59th. I saw several shows...Tango 2x and the Adult version of Sesame Street, Ave. Q. Which was really enjoyable. Since I enjoy watching the Sopranos on cable. I took the Sopranos location tour to Jersey. You get to visit the Lumber Carpet Man, Pizza Land (quick drive by), Satriale's Pork in Kearney, NJ and the Bada Bing. While not the most scenic part of Jersey it was interesting and fun to get out of the city and see shooting locations of the Sopranos show. You also go through the Newark/Harrison part of Jersey. There is a new Hampton Inn in Harrison, just on the other side of the river from Newark and there PATH train station, subway and Newark Penn Station nearby so that could be option to save $$$, taking the train or subway into Manhattan each day??? I've seen rates between around $100 and Trip Advisor reviews are good, probably because it is newer property. Harrison High School is featured in the Sopranos and so the local La Pizza. I also took the subway to the Museum of Natural History around 83rd? The subway stops right below the Museum. For some reason, I did not enjoy the visit. Next trip...I'm going to the Met. I walked by some budget hotels during this trip...the La Quinta on 32nd and the Red Roof on 32nd located in Korea Town. Also walked by Hampton Inn on 31st. I noticed many of hotels were not that tall, so I wonder if street noise would impact the stay. I can not see paying big bucks to stay at the Red Roof or La Quinta. I probably stay at nicer Hilton, Hampton Inn or Marriott in Jersey and commute in than to stay at Old, Unclean Manhattan Hotel and pay $180 - $220.00. In fact, I probably stay in Jersey at at clean, nice and comfortable (quiet room and comfortable bed) and commute in (for business) than stay at crummy expensive Manhattan Hotel. I'm due back in Manhattan in both May for two weeks and June for one week. I will first consider the Residence Inn (Ave. of Americas, I wrote a review about this property) or the Affinia Dumont (wrote a review about this place too). Or might consider commuting from New Jersey. In 2006, I stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown. The bed was more comfortable than the Affinia, but my bed was next to the noisest lift. I don't think I stay at Shelburne again unless they update their decor and get more comfortable beds and more adjustable climate controls but then i probably would not get $149.00 rates either. So for me it is Residence Inn Times Square, Affinia Dumont or a good value clean and modern place in Jersey.",

      "text": "This hotel is still great value for money in NYC. The location is fantastic, only a few block from both Grand Central Station and Chrysler Building, and a 10 min walk from Empire State Building. The rooftop views are spectacular of the Empire State, especially at night. The in-house restaurant, Rare Bar & Grill is also pretty good. The rooms and beds are comfortable and a decent size, and the in-room kitchenettes also come in handy. A block down on Third Ave there is a small grocery store, D'Agostino's. People should be aware of the $25 'resort fee' which is not hugely apparent on their website when you book (it's included as another exclusionary fee or tax). Included in the compulsory resort fee is free wifi, happy hour in the lobby and credit to use at a little convenience section they have in the lobby. The fee is compulsory for every guest, so I don't really know why they don't just up the room price by $25 and include all of these things as hotel benefits. The $10 credit a day isn't going to get you far at the lobby, when you're paying $9 for a 1L bottle of water. This aside, with everything included, the hotel still represents good value for money in NYC. The laundry facilities in the basement are also really handy, especially after a week of travelling, and the room sizes are a lot bigger and better furnished than other hotels around the same price. The staff are helpful and courteous, and when my flight was cancelled a day before my departure they were only too helpful in extending my stay a night.",

      "title": "Indepth lengthy review",
      "text": "We stayed over the Xmas and New Year period for over 2 weeks so got a real feel for the place. You can get a good deal here if you are staying for more than 7 days and I could not beat our deal with any of the travel agents online and therefore booked direct with the hotel. They have a pillow menu and other facilities you can order before you arrive and these were met. We stayed in a studio deluxe room 1402. The Murray Hill area is nice and just outside of the noisy area so you really feel like you are coming back to relax. When telling the taxi driver the hotel address you have to give the cross street as well so we used to say 37th and Lexington. The hotel is a 7 minute walk to Grand Central, 7 minute walk to Bryant Park and 10 minute walk to the Empire State building. There are lots of eateries (e.g. Scotty\u2019s Diner 39th and Lexington) and grocery shops (great sandwiches and salads to take out on corner of 34th St think it\u2019s called the Murray Hill Market) and small supermarkets (D'Agostino 38th and 3rd) nearby. We arrived 2 hrs before check in and Jada at the front desk was amazingly helpful, warm and friendly. She stowed away our bags and took our contact details so she could inform us when our rooms were ready. I have stayed at other hotels in NYC (Michelangelo, NY Palace, Novotel) and this was one of the warmest welcomes I have had. We asked if we could have a room with a view which I did request 3 months prior but were told couldn\u2019t be guaranteed. Jada did say it may be awkward as we were staying so long but she managed to get us a room at the side of the building on the 14th floor with a view of the Chrysler building. However if we had been on lower floors then the view of the \u201ccourtyard\u201d may have been quite dark and depressing (see pics) - I would take a guess that anything ending in 02 and 01 below the 12th floor When we arrived in the room, relaxing music was playing from the MP3/CD player and a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us as we were celebrating out anniversary \u2013 it was a really nice touch and much appreciated. Internet access is only free in the lobby area although we were given complimentary access due to our length of time staying at the hotel. The lobby area is comfortable and not too noisy. The room has dark wood furniture with green and terracotta accents and beige walls which makes it easy on the eye. The bedroom area is large and had 2 wardrobes \u2013 one containing a safe, iron, ironing board and suitcase stand. There were also 2 desks with drawers, 2 bedside tables and a full length mirror \u2013 lots of storage space. There are also 4 lamps in the room as well as flexible reading lights attached to the bed. Because we were in a U shape side of the building the room was a little dark on dull days so I had to sit directly under a lamp to apply makeup. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. Spare blankets were also provided. There is a 32 inch flat screen LG tv opposite the bed that you can change the angle of, with the option for pay to view films. The kitchen area included a small fridge, a large microwave, coffee maker and sink. Tea bags, coffee bags, creamer, sweetener and sugar are provided. These were replenished most of the time. You have to provide your own milk if you prefer tea. The fridge has all the mini bar items inside it so we had to put all these at the bottom so we could use it for storing food. The items were expensive but the prices are well displayed. (see pic). There was also an ice maker in the fridge. There were 2 granite counter worktops and 2 shelves with 2 wine glasses provided. Further priced treats are on the counter top (see pic). There is also a large bin stored under the sink \u2013 make sure no food gets dropped behind it as the design appears to make it awkward to clean. Thanks to the reviewers on TA, I knew to ask for a crockery set (2 each of large plates, small plates, cereal bowls, knives, forks, teaspoons, dessert spoons) and a kettle before going up to the room as I also found as many others have commented that this is not emphasised at check in \u2013 however these were promptly delivered within 15 minutes by the nice housekeeping staff. You are also provided with a couple of cloths and washing up liquid. You can also ask for spare tea towels as well. However housekeeping is not as prompt in the evening as we requested a corkscrew and it took over 45 minutes to arrive. The bathroom is smallish and does not have much storage (there is a shelf under the basin) but suited our needs. The lighting in the bathroom is great \u2013 there are 2 separate switches. The towels are small and more like large hand towels than bath towels \u2013 plenty are provided though. Large bottles of shower gel, conditioner and shampoo are \u201cbolted\u201d to the wall. We did put in 2 requests for the hair conditioner to be filled but both were ignored unfortunately over a 5 day period - both times I found out the hard way. To be fair you cannot tell the conditioner is running low but a printed note does kind of give you a clue. Body lotion and pure vegetable soap is also provided in travel sizes. A hairdryer, spare tissues and loo roll were underneath the basin. The hotel does not provide slippers or robes. The shower temperature does differ depending on how early you shower so if you have kids don\u2019t let them jump straight in thinking that setting the lever at the same spot will provide the same temp. I found it easier to run the water using the bath tap first. It heats up quicker and you only have to turn the lever slightly before 7.00am and after 9.30am. Otherwise it takes a couple of minutes to warm up. Water pressure is average. The thermostat that controls the room temp was near the entrance to the room, although it did not go below 68 degrees so if you wanted it cooler you had to open the window a few inches. The room does warm up quickly which was great in winter. Some TA reviewers complained about there being only 2 lifts \u2013 there are 3 \u2013 the third is at the side of the lift shaft. Our room was by the elevators which can be noisy at times but wasn\u2019t enough to make us move. There is also a fitness centre, I think it\u2019s on the second floor but we did not visit this. We did visit the Rare Bar and Grill \u2013 nice, service was good but expensive for what it was (see separate review). I did not see anything advertising the rooftop bar but that may have been because it is closed in the winter months. However you can still access the rooftop from the 16th floor. The views are amazing. You have the Empire State directly in front of you, Chrysler to the right, East river behind you and on your left in the far distance you can see the Freedom Tower (easier to see it sparkling at night). This was an added bonus and thanks again to TA reviewers. As it was the Xmas and New Year period we saw the Empire in 4 different lighting modes including the New Years light show at a great vantage point. I wasn\u2019t too sure what to make of the concierge initially (David). He sounded very knowledgeable when I heard him discussing shopping options with guests however when I asked him what I could do on Xmas Eve he told me that whatever I chose to do would need to be done early as most things closed by 4.00pm. His only suggestion was to go to St Patricks for midnight mass even though I pointed out that it clearly states that all tickets had gone. He did not suggest anything in the day however I investigated myself and managed to attend 3 carol concerts in the early evening that imbued the Xmas feeling. He did redeem himself when I asked him about New Years Eve options and I enjoyed his dry wit. I had read on TA that the doormen were hit and miss. They do appear to double as bell boys which may account for some of their absence. However I would say that only 30% of the time was there a doorman at the entrance and only 15% of the time was the door opened for us. Taxis do stop outside the hotel regularly and they appear to know the doormen well but make sure you get a quote including tolls if you are going to the airport. We did have a problem with a guest smoking drugs in their room and the smell travelled through the vent in the bathroom and really caused a sickening stench in the room. Reception were very apologetic and said they would get security straight on to it and offered to spray the room however I am allergic to such sprays. We did feel quite ill the next day and it did spoil our morning. It happened again a couple of days later but luckily we were just going out. Again reception apologised and made up our room for us whilst we were out even though we had left later than the usual housekeeping time. (Housekeeping were really pleasant and accommodating when it came to leaving the room late in the morning and would always check with us.) We paid our room bill up front before we entered our room however upon checkout we were charged for one days internet access. This was cleared up quickly and taken off our bill. I would definitely stay here again and would also recommend the area. I think complimentary wireless in general would make this hotel more popular as well as more attentive doormen although I have to say they were always polite and had a smile when I did speak to them. The rooms are large and clean with lots of storage which is always a plus point in NY as well as the amazing rooftop views.",

      "title": "Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location, Excellent Staff",
      "text": "I have just returned from a week long stay at the Affina Murray Hill \u2013 an excellent hotel. Ignore the moaners that have posted reviews, this is a very good hotel for the price and the service was brilliant. Prior to booking a hotel in NY I did extensive research on the best customer rated hotels in my price range and the Affina impressed me for three main reasons, firstly the location and secondly the fact the management regularly respond to negative reviews (so are clearly keen to listen to feedback) and thirdly the fact it has recently been renovated (very nicely too!). Having lived in NY for 4 months several years ago, I was very confident that the location of the Affina would tick all the boxes for getting to the tourist sites and shops. There is no \u2018perfect\u2019 location in New York, if you want to explore the whole city, inevitably wherever you stay, some places will entail a bit of a treck to get to. However, the Affina is great for a walk to all mid-town areas (Empire State, Times Square, 5th Avenue shops, Central Station, UN Building etc) and is only a very short walk away to the 6 train (either at Grand Central or on 33rd Street) and is slightly longer 20 min brisk walk to the 1,2,3 trains (at Penn Station), so it was easy to get everywhere. The neighbourhood is very safe \u2013 we walked back from the subway after 2am on some nights and it was quiet and didn\u2019t feel threatened at all. There are several bars in the area a 5 min walk away. I would highly recommend the rooftop bar on the hotel, it is only open when its not raining, but is very plush and has a great atmosphere and great service\u2026. Not to mention views which are spectacular. The bar off the lobby \u2013 RARE \u2013 is excellent as well. Top class service from the bar and waiting staff and it has a really good atmosphere. We found it a great way to start and end a night out. The food there is great, and very reasonably priced (classic burger for nine dollars!). The breakfast there is also very reasonably priced (ten dollars for coffee, juice, toast and a full cooked breakfast!). The hotel itself is of a very high standard \u2013 the lobby area is very comfortable and stylish and very clean. We were very impressed with the size of our room. Having stayed in New York Hotels previously and many in London, city hotel rooms are generally very small\u2026. We only had a standard room, but it was massive! The beds were I think queen size and the bed linen (and much commented upon pillows\u2026!) were very comfortable and in fact I would go as far to say the best bed I have ever had from a hotel. We also had a microwave and fridge in our room, which were a nice touch, but we didn\u2019t use them. The air con was a god send in 90 degree heat, and having been shown how to switch it off (found it silent at night\u2026 just use the control panel on the actual metal unit on the left hand side to set the fan speed and switch off completely) and the thermostat on the wall controls the temperature. The bathroom was ample size and very very clean (I\u2019m quite fussy over bathrooms and this had nothing to complain about). My only slight moan would be that the bath towels could have been bigger, but they did leave you 4 of them, so more than made up for size in quantity! The elevator is slow at times, but that\u2019s only because at 9am in the morning, you get a lot of people checking out, filling the lift with cases and it takes a while\u2026. If you can\u2019t handle a five minute wait \u2013 you are missing out on a great hotel! We found it quite nice the way guests would talk in the elevator or whilst waiting for it, rather a nice touch, personally. As for noise \u2013 we genuinely didn\u2019t hear anything that caused us any alarm. Indeed on some nights, we commented it was so quiet we couldn\u2019t believe we were in a city. We were on the back of the hotel into the atrium, so no road noise. There was some slight music noise form the upstairs bar, but as we were not in bed at 8pm, didn\u2019t bother us\u2026. If you were looking for an early night on a Friday night, there could possibly be some noise you may want to consider. By way of accommodation \u2013 I could not fault the hotel. We got excellent rates on Expedia and I would recommend the Affina to any friends/colleagues coming to New York, providing it keeps getting good reviews, I would definitely return next year. The service we received from the hotel staff was also of a high standard I can\u2019t fault anyone. Door staff were excellent, the member of staff who carried our bags to the room, gave us a tour of the facilities and how to operate the air con (including how to turn it off), how to use the TV, fridge, ice box, lights, lamps and microwave\u2026. This saved us so much time! The cleaner was never seen or heard, but did a great job \u2013 every morning when we got back from breakfast our room was made fresh. The reception and concierge were all helpful with our queries. Maintenance in particular were very helpful \u2013 when we arrived, I had a problem with my hair straighteners (voltage issues\u2026 nothing to do with the hotel) and I wanted to borrow an adapter\u2026. Reception didn\u2019t have any, but sent someone up from maintenance to see if they could help, after playing around with them, he went to get an adapter for me\u2026. Although it still didn\u2019t work, it was just excellent service helping me with something that wasn\u2019t even the hotel\u2019s problem. In the end it couldn\u2019t be fixed so they directed me to the nearest shop to buy some (on a Sunday evening). We also had maintenance change lamps in the room, which we hadn\u2019t even reported as broken, because the cleaning staff had noticed a bulb out\u2026. My only suggestions about how the hotel could be improved are to make Wi-Fi free (or at least have pc's in the lobby with free acess to the internet. I only wanted to quickly check emails or facebook and it was thirteen dollars a day or sixty nine for the week..... way too much! Also, tea or coffee making facilities in the room would have been most welcome. Whilst im sure if we had asked, they would have provided them, it would have been nice to be able to make a cuppa in the morning. All in all \u2013 whilst we didn\u2019t spend that much time in our room as we were out exploring, whilst in New York on a tiring week, if your hotel is awful it really can ruin your entire trip \u2013 so I am very pleased that all the research I put in to find a great hotel paid off and we had an excellent stay\u2026.. My summary is that it is an excellent value hotel, great rooms and facilities and helpful staff. P.S \u2013 I can highly recommend Rossini\u2019s restaurant on 38th Street between Lexington and Park\u2026. It is very old school new york, with a pianist most nights and only 2 min walk from the hotel. It was wonderful.",

I went down to the front desk and exlplained the situation and was offered another room , that was supposed to be an upgrade because it had a separate sofa bed , but guess what it was even dirtier than the first one , I found rice in the sofa bed and lots of dust , and that room was bigger but didn't have the pantry kitchen just a mini fridge which was very dirty,we decided to stay in the first room because we were tired from our road trip and with the weather we weren't in the mood of finding another hotel and moving etc. Last year we stayed at the Dumont which is a better hotel by the way just three blocks down on the 34th St., and overall it was better stay but we weren't happy with the overall cleanliness of the room , but I decided to give Affinia another try thinking that maybe it was because of the high season or something like that but what a mistake. I've stayed at all the Affinia NY hotels except the Manhattan and the Shelburne has the best Lobby of all of them and also the Rare Grill is good, those are the Pro's of the Shelburne., Also the staff service is very good and they're very polite and helpful but Affinia really needs to train their house keeping staff and improve the cleanliness of their properties . Personally I'll never stay here again, I might stay at the Gardens again if I can get a good deal but I doubt it the Gardens is always way more expensive.",

      "text": "PLEASE READ THE WHOLE POST SO YOU CAN HOPEFULLY AVOID A TERRIBLE STAY IN NYC. Horrible experience at the Shelburne Hotel NYC. My wife called the hotel in advance to confirm whether they have cribs available as we have a 5 month old son. The hotel employee said that they do have cribs. However, once we got there (at 8pm at night with a tired jet lagged baby) they gave us an old, stained, odorous graco play pen instead. The play pen didn't have a net to place a baby higher up and instead the mat would have to be placed at the bottom where the metal peices could be felt through the mat (less than 2 inches above the dirty, dusty carpeted floor). I have three compressed vertebrae in my spine and my wife recently had a car accident (rear ended) so we have difficulty bending over very far and holding weight (our son) at the same time (which the hotel employees we spoke to were made aware of). When I spoke to the manager on duty for Friday, Sep. 14, 2018 about the play pen, the lady working there repeatedly told me it was a crib and not a play pen. It literally says play pen on it. I have pictures and video as proof. After she argued about it being a crib and tried to convince me otherwise I asked her if she had any children to which she said \"no\". Then I told her to google the word 'crib' and then the word ' play pen' and see what comes up. Absolutely disgusting to have to argue with her as to what an actual crib was and wasting the first several hours of our trip trying to sort out what to do for our son so he could sleep at night and nap during the day safely. She also had the audacity to say we could buy a crib from a store if we like. Really? We were visiting from Vancouver, Canada and we are going to buy a crib for 4 nights because you first lied to us about having a crib and then argued that a play pen is a crib. So needless to say that for the 4 nights we were there I had to sleep in the chair and my wife and son slept on the bed. This is the first time our son has slept on a bed and we spent most of the night terrified he would roll off or inadvertantly be smothered by the blanket when my wife moved in the middle of the night in her sleep. They also have a pillow menu advertised on the website and have a literal pillow menu card in the room. When I called the second night to order a swedish memory foam pillow (as that is what we use at home) the gentleman at the front desk said they do not have a pillow menu anymore and that we only have regular pillows. When I spoke to the manager (Ecker) about the crib situation (which got us nowhere) I happened to mention the pillow issue to which he sounded surprised and said that they do have the pillow menu and that the pillows are available. That shows me that the employees are either not well trained and are uninformative, or lazy. My wife suffered a cut on her heel while at the hotel and I called the front desk to ask if they have a first aid kit to which the lady said \"we have bandaids\". I said that's fine we'll take 2 bandaids please. The next day we wanted to clean the wound and replace the bandaid and the gentleman at the front desk told my wife they don't carry bandaids. I might be mistaken but I would assume a first aid kit may be a legal necessity for a hotel to have on hand. And again an uninformed and/or lazy front desk clerk. This was not a 4 star hotel by any means. It was dirty, smelled of cigarette smoke and they refused to move us to a different room. We would have been better off in a dingy motel at a quarter the cost. And at the end they had the audacity to charge a $35 (+fees/taxes) per night \"facility fee\" that they failed to mention when we checked in. Worst \"hotel\" I have had the misfortune to be stuck in.",

      "text": "Located about six blocks (street not avenue) from Grand Central straight up Lexington Ave., the Affinia Shelburne is an easy five minute walk from the Metro and the 4,5,6, S, and 7 lines. There are many eating choices in the area. We liked the deli on the SE corner of 42nd (two bagels and two sandwiches... $7... not bad for NYC, plus a coffee and bagel special before 10:30AM, and an extensive hot and cold food set up with delicious fruit... open 24/7), and the Cuban joint with outstanding empanadas a few doors closer. There's also a Starbuck's on the other side of the street and one block closer on Lex than the deli, probably about 41st Street. Both the Starbuck's and the deli have free WiFi. The hotel staff could not be friendlier or more helpful. They really seem as if they WANT to make your stay in NYC enjoyable. In the morning they have coffee set up in the lobby and in the evening a delightful fruit punchy non-alcoholic cocktail thingy. The concierge, Chris was his name I believe, not only gave us several good tips but I overheard him doing the same with others. Our room, 811, was large and quite functional with a coffee maker, microwave, mini-fridge, two TVs, and a bit of a view of the Empire State Building. We ventured up to the 16th floor rooftop area and although there was a lot of snow up there (we were in the City during the big Christmas blizzard) the view was amazing, with the ESB and the Chrysler clear as could be. The summer bar deal up there is probably quite nice, but its run by the Rare lobby restaurant. There were two downsides. First, the hotel has this 1990s attitude about Internet service, which is that you have to pay $13 per day for WiFi or .50 cents a minute to use the computers in the lobby. I mean, c'mon. It's time for the Affinia to cross the Rubicon into the 21st century. No major hotel or motel chain that I've stayed in or am aware of charges for Internet access anymore. Second, the Rare restaurant bar tried to charge my wife $1.50 for a thimble-sized splash of salad dressing to take to the room. We're guests at the hotel, all but no one from the street goes into that restaurant, they get their business from the hotel guests who enter from the lobby. Too many of these kinds of things start to make the management look like they're trying to nickel and dime you to death. So, we went other places for the Internet (see above), and when returning in the evening from a show or being out or dinner or whatever, and wanting a drink, we opted out of their too-tight Rare restaurant bar and just stopped at the Roosevelt on 45th and Madison for a less expensive drink in a more attractive setting.",

      "text": "My husband and I were referred this hotel by one of my trustworthy colleagues. Since we have never visited NY before for leisure, I was unsure of a good hotel. (I should have gone with the Fitzpatrick Manhattan which was my first choice). Affina Shelburne check in/out was good. Location great - close to shopping, restaurants etc. Concierge, April and door man Dennis were great as well. Room size was good. RARE grill, expensive and not the cleanest. Front Desk and service - ok. Elevators - small and very slow. Remodel - tried to look expensive, quality of the renovation work was not good at all. We arrived at the hotel and check in was good since it was early part of the day. I asked if our room was ready at front desk since it was before checkin in time and she said yes, I also asked if some preferences that I included in my reservation and asked if those were able to be accomodated. She advised yes and proceeded to give us our room key etc. Note: I did confirm that all rooms had showers AND a bathtub before booking my reservation and the answer was YES. We proceeded to the room with the bell man and baggage (elevator very small and slow) and the room she gave us was a walk in shower with a shower curtain - one of my requests was a glass shower with a tub. So we went back to the front desk and queried again and now I was told that some rooms have showers and tubs with the shower curtain, others just have the glass shower or walk in shower. So I told them that I would like a tub please, so she gave us the key to another room. We said we will check it out before dragging our luggage to another room and be unsatisfied. Checked it out and there was a shower and tub alright with a GREAT BIG BLACK MOLD LINE were the grout/caulking finishes for the tile and where the tub begins - GROSS. So needless to say we didn't take that room and since there was no one from fron desk accompanying us we couldn't show them, but we told them. So now we are on to our 3rd room. This room had the similiar issue with the tub, but not as bad, a rust ring around the tub faucet, hair on the shower curtain liner and in the tub and dirt on the mirror. We complained again and housekeeping came and changed the shower liner (which they apologized for) and noted the black grout/mold would have to be cleaned while we were out because of the kind of chemical they were going to use. Housekeeping also advised that it all may not come out becaue that is the kind of grout/caulking that was used. OK, by this time we are tired and irritated. So we just settled in this room (which was room #1501 on the 15th floor) which was by the elevator where I specifically requested NOT TO BE. Well, throughout the night a fly was buzzing around my ears - yes, a fly. Ok - cool, killed it and went back sleep - ANOTHER one came on buzzing....I woke my husband up cos it took me a while to catch that one - had the lighgts on and everything. Finally killed that one - this one was a mosquito looking one and the other was a fruit fly type. The next day we told front desk about it and they said they'll have it checked. While we were getting ready to go out, we killed about another 4 yes 4 and left one visible so they can see it. We let them know we left the dead one for them to see and we went to breakfast in the RARE grill where would you believe the SAME FLIES were there!!! No kidding!!!!!!!!! When we got back to the room, housekeeping had been there, but there was not note stating they checked the fly issue. While we dropping our shopping bags off there was another fruit fly. The bed was made, trashed wasn't emptied and mirror still dirty. We went back out and on our way out we stopped to the front desk to ask if the issue had been looked into. She wasn't sure as she just came in. She offered us to have maintenence come and have a look when we get back and another room but the hotel was totally booked and we could have the room the next night , but we were already irritated. We knew the next room could be worse - I guess the saying, you know what you've got, but you don't know what you're going to get was applied. When we arrived back to the room maintenence came and sprayed some sort of spray - it had VERY VERY MINIMAL ODOR. After it was about 2 or 3 for the rest of our stay. I was sooooo glad to be leaving that hotel at the end of our stay.... During checkout we asked could they discount us for the inconvenience of the fly issue and front desk said all they can do is discount our movie which was already discounted because when we went to play it all these lines were showing up you couldn't see the movie and it was frozen!!! The room service lunch they couldn't discount ($49) beacuse the restaurant is not theirs and they couldn't adjust the room rate because of how it was in the computer. So, we were offered compliementary breakfast in the RARE grill....I really wasn't feeling that at all, but we took it. I was confused - you could offer complimentary breakfast to the RARE grill though it's not your restaurant , but you can't take off the lunch and pay for it out of the hote's pocket?! Anyway, at at the grill for breakfast again since I didn't have to pay for it and the flies were still there..;. I thank the hotel for trying to make us comfortable, but I was very disappointed and not impressed with this hotel, I will not return and I will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!!!!!!!! BTW - having trouble getting pics of my camera, so sorry couldn't take/post any...",

      "text": "My husband & i satyed at the micheangelo during labor day weekend. We searched for the right hotel with valet parking for a long time, & thanks to tripadvisor, we found the right one for an amazingly low rate for NYC hotels. We booked ahead of time through booking.com & the hotel staff called us couple days prior to our arrival to confirm our stay, & we were pleased they were so organized! The hotel was really in a PERFECT location, 5 to 10 min walk to almost all the major detinations (times square, central park..etc.) plus both buses & subway stations were very close. We used both & were very pleased with their convinience. We were upgraded to a double king room, which wasn't really necessary, but definitely nice.The rooms were very quiet & kept very clean & both the bed & the pillows were first class, the best i've ever experienced.. very comfy i'd have hard time getting out of bed in the morning:). The bathroom was quite large with marble, although i'd have liked it to include a tub, but that i knew before i came. my only complain about the room was that due to some of my allergy problems i felt sick because of the carpet. Too bad since all the hotel was covered with it, & this is the first time my allergy gets worse because of a hotel carpet! Yes the AC was noisy, my husband said you get used to it but i slept with ear plugs & it was fine. All the hotel staff was very nice & helpful at all times. There was a complementary breakfast for free, that included beverages (hot milk, hot milk with chocolate -delicious-, coffee & even espresso) & different cakes & pastries. Although it was good we only had breakfast in the hotel once. All in all, to us, the hotel was a good 4* property rather than a 5*. We always found the doorman in another hotel entry (which was weird) & the whole lobby place was small, even the breakfast place was squeezed right to the cheking area. But one thing's for sure, it was a great hotel with a reasonable price with one of the greatest location ever & we definitely recommend this place. Tips : We never ate at the hotel & used the italian neighbourhood (which was ok), & 9th street (15-20min walk from the hotel), best place ever for food. I've never seen so many reaturants squeezed in one place, & the choice of the different vareity of cuisine was just unbelievable, i'd really recommand this place! We went to century 21 (You have to go if you have time) & we definitely had the best buys ever! We took a tuk tuk tour in central park which was so much fun, for about 45min we've seen most of it for only $40 (including tips). If you want to take the bus you have to buy tickets from any subway station prior to getting in it!! We took the ferry back & forth (for free i couldn't believe it) to staten island & we saw the statue of liberty. On our way, we saw some people on boat tours who were closer to the statue but we didn't have time, plus we had a good viwe of it as well. One of the best spot to see it, is that once u get in the ferry, take the first step you see, once upstairs turn to ur left & go outside on ur left & stick to ur place & enjoy!",

      "text": "I just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and did not enjoy how I was treated by the staff. We arrived just before midnight from the UK on a flight that had been delayed 3hrs. Needless to say we were extremely tired and jetlagged. We checked in and were asked to provide card details for \u2018incidentals\u2019, which I am aware is fairly standard and something I have experienced in most hotels. I said \u2018is my Cash Passport ok to provide?\u2019, as I was travelling with a pre-paid Travelex Cash Passport which I was trialling for the first time. He said yes, everything was fabulous. In the morning when I checked my balance I saw they had taken out $400 from my Cash Passport and I had only taken $500 with me. This was a big shock as I was NOT told any money was going to be taken out of my account and I was certainly not told how much. I spoke to a new guy on reception called Walter, who openly blamed me for the error and said I should never give a debit card for this purpose and that the money would be refunded when we checked out. He was patronising and rude and said every hotel in the world does this (not true) and what did I expect? I was being as calm as possible but was on the verge of tears at this point. I asked if he could refund the Cash Passport and said we would provide another card (although I don\u2019t own a credit card). He said it was a Sunday so the money probably wouldn\u2019t go straight back on but he did process the refund. In between Sunday and Tuesday we had a lot of issues with Travelex, and I urge you to not use their Cash Passport cards (or at least read my review on them to hear why!). We returned to reception on Tuesday and explained to Joe Dia that Travelex required the hotel to confirm that they didn\u2019t need the money they\u2019d refunded us. Only then would they release the funds back into my account. I said this needed to be typed up and signed, sent on hotel headed paper. However he wasn\u2019t listening at all and printed out a page that said \u2018The Michelangelo\u2019 at the top and hand wrote \u2018Funds don\u2019t need to be taken\u2019. I kept reading out the requirements I needed, but he wasn\u2019t listening. Needless to say, Travelex didn\u2019t respond to this so we still had no money. Eventually someone from Travelex phoned us and said they had contacted the accountant at the hotel called Nancy. Nancy had told them some misinformation, seeing as she didn\u2019t know who we were or the problems we were having. I had to return back to reception and ask for the manager. I spoke to a lady called June and was starting to explain my problem but she clearly wasn\u2019t listening and just glared at me. Then Walter comes back and said quite aggressively, \u2018LOOK, I was very clear that the refund was going to take 3 working days\u2019 etc etc (which is also not something he ever said). I had to say \u2018please can I just explain!\u2019 before they listened \u2013 I needed the hotel to simply confirm that they allowed the refund. June and Walter were then openly exasperated with both Joe (who had previously provided us with the ridiculous document) and Nancy the accountant, discussing in front of me how she just goes and does things without asking anyone. Eventually the manager spoke to us and helped us contact Travelex and get our money back. It took 5 minutes, yet we had been waiting 3 days without any money. We checked out the following day and sat in the mezzanine upstairs to wait so we could be away from reception because June and Walter were there again and I did not feel comfortable around them. This all happened on my partners birthday and the trip to New York was a surprise. I was very upset by all the mess caused and miscommunications and felt bad that he spent his birthday comforting me through all this drama. I had also previously informed the hotel we were celebrating a birthday as I asked for a room with a nice view. Our room had zero natural light and the view was a brick wall! To conclude, the hotel was clean and nice and the location was good for what we wanted, however the room was extremely dark with a view of a wall and the staff made me feel very uncomfortable and both caused and prolonged a huge drama over money. I won\u2019t be returning!",

      "title": "Fantastic Value For New York City",
      "text": "Stayed two nights at The Michelangelo over Columbus Day weekend. We booked early so got an excellent rate (for New York) of $260 per night through the hotel's website for a King bedded room. We wanted something centrally located and it proved to be the perfect place for us as it's just a few blocks from the heart of Times Square and only two blocks on the same street to the Gershwin Theater where we had tickets for \"Wicked\". Check-in was quick but we did have to wait for our room to be ready. We had arrived at 2:30pm and they said to check back at 3pm. We just went into the lobby bar and had some drinks while we waited. ($18 for one martini and one soda! - but that's NYC for ya) Room was ready promptly at 3. We were assigned to room 520. Based on the photos I've seen here on Trip Advisor and looking at the emergency map on the door in the room, I'd say we were in one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, but it was still good-sized with a King bed, two comfy armchairs and ottoman, large dresser with flat screen TV, mini-bar, and desk. There is internet service available for a daily fee. There was no safe in the room though which was annoying. We had to check valuables in the safe deposit box at the front desk. Bathroom appeared to be small at first look but proved to be the perfect size; toilet and tub have their own door to close off from the sink/vanity area. The tub was actually quite large and great for a shower as you didn't feel closed in with the curtain brushing up against you. There were heat lamps in the tub room to help you dry off faster. Water pressure/temperature was perfect in the shower. Hot water pressure was very weak at the sink though, and there was a slow drain. Two bathrobes were provided as well as the standard amenity collection (shampoo, lotion, etc.) The room was one of the cleanest I have ever seen. Only complaint I had was one of my pillowcases had what looked to be like a make-up smudge on it. I'm not sure if it was permanent but I took the case off and luckily there was a second case underneath. Housekeeping replaced the cases the next day. One other minor complaint was the cleaning products they used had a perfume fragrance that was nearly overpowering upon entering the room for the first time. We had to open one of the windows to air it out. This helped also in cooling the room as it got a bit stuffy and warm at times. The A/C had apparently been turned off for the season as adjusting the thermostat down just turned the heat off it didn't turn any A/C or fan on. The bed was extremely comfortable and made for pleasant sleeping. The chairs in the room were also plush and comfortable. Room was very quiet. Even though we faced out onto 51st the windows were well insulated and kept the city noises to a minimum. Hotel overall was also very quiet. We never ran into any other people in the halls, and the lobby maybe had a dozen people in it at most at any given time. This made it a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city around it. Housekeeping service, while they did a great cleaning job, seemed inconsistent on when and what service they gave. For example, our first night there we had left the hotel by 6pm and did not return until around 11:30. We received no turndown service. I assumed they didn't do any, but on our second night we had gone out and asked for an extra pillow to be sent up. When we got back later we found the pillow and found that turndown service had been done. On our first morning we left our room by 10:30am and did not return until around 1. We had left the please clean room sign on the door. When we returned, the sign had been removed and was on the floor inside the room but the room had not been cleaned. We were going right out again and called housekeeping to make sure the room was going to be cleaned. When we got back a few hours later it had. One great plus with the hotel was check-out was at 1pm. I have never encountered that with any hotel before. Parking is available with valet but the charge is around $50-60 per night. Self-park is available at the garage on the same block for only $27 a night. Hotel will stamp your ticket at check-out. Yes, the garage has a steep incline leading out and you'll have to haul your bags up it, but then it's just half a block walk to the hotel. Also, on the same block is a 24 hour grocery/cafe which was very handy to pick up drinks and snacks for the room. Room service is available of course but was very pricey. The only staff members we encountered were at the front desk and bar and they were all pleasant enough. Overall, this was one of the best stays I've had at a NYC hotel and I would highly recommend especially if you can get a reasonable rate like we did.",

      "text": "We booked 7 nights at this hotel after reading all of great reviews on trip advisor and paid just over $2700.00. On arriving at the hotel just before 3pm we were greeted at reception and we were advised that we might like to consider a suite since we were staying 6 nights however this would be at an additional cost of $100.00 per night and so we declined, we were then told that an internally facing room was available immediately but that if we wanted to wait half an hour we could have a room with an external view, we said that we would wait. An hour and twenty minutes later and after being told several times that we would only be waiting another 10 minutes, I went back to the reception desk and asked why we had witnessed several other families checking in, all of whom had been given rooms immediately when we were still waiting, a less than friendly and enthusaistic receptionist informed me that we were still waiting because of my specific request to be on the 3rd floor??? I then explained that I had made no such specifications and had simply agreed to wait half an hour for an externally facing room, we were then immediately given a room on the 6th floor and were finally able to get some rest after an 8 hour flight. During the wait we were not offered anything to drink but we were given a buy one get one free wine voucher, we got a very curt apology but it didn't feel genuine at all, overall the impression we got was that we were an irritation to the front desk staff. Got to the room and it was fine, very good size for New York standards and was clean enough, bathroom was a bit dated but nothing really to complain about. The bed was also very comfortable. We noticed on an evening that other rooms were being given a turn down service, and other reviewers on trip advisor have confirmed they received this service with chocolate- we didn't receive any turn down service for the duration of our stay, I have no idea why?? If you passed staff members in the corridors such as the maids etc they always greeted you, however reception staff never acknowledged us and sometimes the door man would greet us and other times it was like we were invisable. Overall we found the front of house staff to be uninterested and disengaged, it was very dissapointing. The biggest positive about this hotel is its location, other reviewers are correct when they say that that it is a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city yet it is right around the corner from Times Square. However there are hundreds of hotels in the area all benefitting from the fact that they too are in a good location, so location is not really a unique selling point of the Michelangelo. I have read many reviews about how wonderful this hotel is and how other travellers received brilliant service and were made to feel special, unfortunetly I can't say that we experienced this at the Michelangelo. Next time I visit New York I will certainly stay in the same area of Manhatten but not at this hotel, if I am going to spend approx $385 per night for a room and stay 7 nights then I expect a level of service to match the price. My advice... look at what deals are available at other hotels in the area. This hotel did nothing to lure us back and we felt our custom was not appreciated.",

      "title": "OK, But Not Excellent",
      "text": "I made my second visit to The Michelangelo for one night on September 13, 2006. I travel to NYC on business from time to time throghout the year and chose the Michelangelo for this short trip as the hotels I usually stay at for business (Intercontinental Barclay, Omni Berkshire, The Regency) were priced in the $600-$800 per night range. Obviously, demand for hotel rooms was high on that date but, honestly, I can't even bring myself to spend someone else's money at that rate for a hotel room. By comparison, the $395 rate I paid at The Michelangelo was within reason. After my second stay, I still came away from the experience with the same feeling as my first visit. It was just OK. Not that it was bad; it was just OK. Check in was a breeze and I was in my corner executive room in mere minutes. Hallways and elevators were very clean. I saw no discarded room service trays or carts in the hallways. I like that. The room was very large, by any city's standards, and was very clean except for a muted stain on the floor between the two queen beds. Someone had tried their very best to clean it but a slight stain was still visible (probably red wine and I realize you can't do much about that). The room had three windows and was quite pleasant. The vaulted ceilings were a nice touch as well. I was on the fourth floor (Rm. 415) and noticed very little noise from 7th Avenue. Contrary to prior reviews, my air conditioning unit was noisy but not to the point where it impeded my sleep. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. I was amazed, however, at the size and quality of the television. I opened the doors of the very nice amoire and found a Wal-Mart quality television that was, at the very most, 20 inches. Picture and sound quality were, unfortunately, exactly what you would expect. Here's where the air conditioning comes into play. When the air conditioning would cycle on, I would have to turn the TV volume up and, consequently turn it back down when the air conditioning would shut off. A minor annoyance but still an annoyance. Prices of flat panel TV's are dropping like a rock. If The Michelangelo wants to compete in this space, they need to upgrade their televisions immediately. Again, not a huge deal but still an annoyance. I did not use the in-room internet connection and I don't know if Wi-Fi is available. The bathroom was spotless and the closet was quite large. Good stuff. \"Breakfast\" was included in my room rate and consisted of tasty little pastries, a bowl of apples, tea and coffee. I don't drink coffee or tea so some juice or bottled water would have been nice. And, as I think of it, some cups of yogurt would have been a plus. Again, just OK. The only real downside to breakfast was that there was no tray for used dishes and napkins and no staff were present to keep the area clean so people were forced to leave their dishes to pile up on coffee tables and side tables in the sitting area of the lobby near the food. For the limited amount of time that the breakfast is available, having staff clean the area is really a must have. I did not use the hotel restaurant, bar or room service. Check out went very smoothly, my bill was correct and I was on my way. Would I stay there again? Yes, but only if I am again faced with the huge price disparity between The Michelangelo and the other hotels I usually visit. Typically, the difference is rates is negligible. Not long after I made my reservation, the room rate at The Michelangelo increased to the going rate. I was considering staying an additional night, but was told the $395 rate was not available for the second night. The same room would have been an additional $300 for the second night. Just being OK, The Michelangelo isn't worth $695 in my opinion. Who knows, maybe somebody paid it. It just wasn't going to be me. I realize this is not the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons but the little things really do add up. The Michelangelo has a good base from which to build, they just need to button a few things up.",

      "text": "Let me start on a positive note: The Michelangelo is a decent hotel. It is located just close enough to Times Square...a few blocks away from the mayhem and noise but still in an area that keeps the theaters and many tourist sites in walking distance. Our rooms were clean. The lobby is nice and the elevators cruise between the floors practically at jet speed. Some of the staff that we encountered were very helpful and friendly. If we had been paying to stay at a Holiday Inn, I would have mentioned all of the above and chalked this up to a decent review. Our expectations of this property, however, were on par with the price of the rooms. I'd suggest that you can do much better for your money, even in the same area of midtown. The downsides? We stayed in one of the pricier rooms, and it was weirdly lacking in many of the basic amenities that you'd find elsewhere (in NYC or Iowa, for that matter). No coffee pot, no safe, no iron/ironing board. Though we did have at least one towel per guest, there was one day where we were left to arm wrestle over a single washcloth. When our early-risers ventured downstairs to look for coffee at 6:30am each day, they were out of luck -- they had to leave the hotel and travel a half block down for a cup o' Joe. Those of us sticking to colder drinks had to search the floors for an ice machine (Handy tip: It is on the 5th floor). Coffee did finally appear in the lobby a little later in the morning alongside a tray of small, dry pastries. This is the 'Continental breakfast' advertised with the room rates. Not a huge deal to us, but I haven't ever stayed in a hotel where anyone tried to pass this off as a 'free breakfast'. The hotel would be better off not promoting it this way and just offering it in the lobby as a nice amenity. I also just noticed that we had almost the exact same experience mentioned by an earlier review here on TripAdvisor. I had confirmed a room with two king beds a few days before we arrived. Upon check-in, we were told that there was a problem with the reservation and that a room with two beds was not available. The manager showed us up to a one bedroom suite with a single king bed, and offered to upgrade us and provide cots. Our kids are willing to sleep pretty much anywhere and the manager was graciously allowing us to check-in early, so we agreed. He called up a few minutes later to offer a larger suite for an additional $100/night. Still just one bed, but the living room was much larger and we wouldn't have to be climbing over cots. We agreed to the upgrade. The problem? The first night they brought up a single cot, but no blankets or pillows. Second night? Blankets, but no pillows. It was totally fine for one kid to sleep on the large sofa, but it would have been great to have the linens to make it into a bed. Though I still feel like the additional room charge was reasonable for the extra space, the room certainly didn't feel like an 'upgrade' when we had to sort out basic sleeping arrangements for two people every night. A stay in a hotel charging over $300/night shouldn't be that much work.",

There are a lot of people that like the style of the hotel but I thought it was ok. The room I got was facing a wall but since I was there for only there for two nights I didn\u2019t care much. The biggest issue I had with my stay was the fact that they charged an extra $40 per day service fee for stuff that I did not need or should have need included: 1. Business center access 2. Gym access 3. Internet 4. $10 / day drink voucher 5. $10 of car service if you book through them 6. 15% discount for next booking 7. Maybe another couple if things I didn\u2019t need but could not remember. The first three things should be a given for a hotel that is already charging $200 plus a night. The internet was not that great and they even try and get you to pay another $20 per day for faster internet. You can decide on your own if you think the extra $40 per day is worth it but it wasn\u2019t for me by any stretch. After the taxes and fees my daily rate was close to 40% higher so buyer beware.",

      "text": "We have been staying at the Michelangelo for more than 25 years and have written numerous positive reviews for this hotel. It is difficult but necessary to report on our most recent experience. The friendliness of front desk service personnel, valet and doormen has always been variable at this hotel but overshadowed by those that remember you from previous visits and the wonderful atmosphere however this past stay was a turn in the wrong direction. We arrived at noon as did other guests the day we checked in and were greeted by a doorman, Carlos, who was put out that people were there before \"check-in\" time at 3. He was rude to all of the guests...I wouldn't have found his attitude acceptable at any level of hotel. We were promised our rooms by 3:00 when checking in early...got one room by that time and the other..right across the hall was not done for two more hours. My repeated calls to the front desk regarding the second room typically went unanswered by the front desk and this remained an issue throughout our stay. Unacceptable for a hotel of this quality to basically be unavailable for guest service on most calls to the front desk. The day manager, Brian was apologetic for the room delay and sent up a bottle of wine and a nice note the following day. In the lobby area for breakfast, the servers were complaining when we and others simply ordered a continental breakfast rather than a full meal as he would not get a good gratuity. We just returned home and my wife asked me to call to see if housekeeping found a dress she might have left. Once again it took numerous calls to the front desk before getting a response and after being referred to housekeeping...the attendant in that department was unable to reach security to check the lost and found. Hours later I'm still waiting for a return call. The rooms were as always very comfortable...other staff such as Henry were as delightful and helpful as always. The food is excellent for room service and meals in the lobby area. For those looking to receive a full five star hotel experience in NYC...I recommend the Michelangelo now with caution as our last stay was far from that.",

Within the last 2 years it has become a Westin, and has gone through, and probably is continuing to go through a transformation. My corporate headquarters is across the street, so I have stayed there several times since the switch, whereas I would not have stayed there for all the tea in China before. This is a good, very busy Midtown Hotel. They are in the process of a complete renovation, which the hotel DESPERATELY needed, and the hard work is starting to pay off. The restaurant and bar have been completely redone, the rooms and halls are probably still in process, but mostly done. The rooms are a decent size, nicely appointed, and clean. For Midtown, they are relatively quiet, but this is the city that never sleeps, so you'll always hear something. The hotel serves primarily business, but you really can't beat the location if you are coming to town to be a tourist. Grand Central is 2 blocks away, the New York City Public Library and 5th Ave are just 3 blocks away, Times Square is an easy 10-15 min walk (or you can take the S shuttle on the subway that goes back and forth between Grand Central and Times Square stations), ditto the Theater District. There are a huge number of restaurants in the neighborhood, everything from 5 Guys Burgers & Fries to linen napkin fine dining. The UN is a couple of blocks away, and many of the countries have their Missions in the neighborhood, so there is a definite international feel to the area. As far as the service issues a few other members have noted, I personally have not experienced any issues, but I do think there is a transition between the Helmsley culture and the Starwood culture under way, and that is one big transition! Room service is decent, but unless you are late-nighting it, there are so many great little restaurants in the area, you should try those. I'm a Starwood junkie, so between that and being across the street from work, I do have a bias, but over the years I've stayed at most of the hotels in the area. I like what they've done with this property, and objectively I think I can say they have continued to improve and get better and better. I will definitely continue to stay here. SPECIAL WARNING: Don't stay here when the U.N. General Assembly is meeting. The constant motorcades and security sweeps result in gridlock in the area. If you plan to travel primarily by foot you'll be fine, but if you need cabs, car service, bus, etc, you can have a very long, and expensive wait trying to get to or from the hotel. Ask the hotel, they know when the UN is in.",

      "text": "This Westin is entirely mediocre / average. The hallways are shabby and dated. The bathrooms are fine, but nothing impressive. Housekeeping woke me up twice. They announced \"housekeeping!!\" as they were opening my door and I was still asleep (at 10am). How about knocking and actually waiting to see if someone is home? I said I was sleeping. Housekeeping entered my room again 20 minutes later and yelled \"housekeeping!!!\" Really? What makes you think I'm awake and want housekeeping 20 minutes later? The minute I exited my room, someone breathlessly asked if they could clean my room now. At finer hotels, this all happens seamlessly without the guest realizing that it's being done or being bothered and pestered. My room was connected to another room by a locked door. Unfortunately, I could hear each time my neighbor coughed, and I could hear kids talking and playing. The extra charges at this hotel are just silly. If I'm paying over $300 for room, don't nickle and dime me. It's tacky. And if you want to make extra money, just charge a little more for my room. I was appalled that wireless in my room would cost $15. The \"business center\" charged by the hour to use a computer and charged for printing. Again, tacky. If you're a high-class hotel with high room rates, you can afford to provide a complementary business center. The room service prices are a joke. I expect to pay higher-than-reasonable prices for room service. I don't expect the prices to reach insanity. Regular cereal - like Raisin Bran - was $14! Add in the room service fee, taxes, etc and that's $20 for a bowl of cereal. You can literally buy 5-6 BOXES for this price. Oh, and a pet peeve of mine... the \"bell men\" will treat you rudely if you don't tip whatever amount they have decided is sufficient. My tipping varied based on the service provided and the dollar bills I had on me. In a good hotel, a basic level of service should be consistent regardless of tip, and staff should not make it painfully obvious that their behavior is entirely motivated by tips. It's rude and tacky. The Westin failed this. Positives: The location is very good. Comfy beds. The room size was very good for NYC and my view was great. The lobby is attractive with a trendy vibe and makes you think you're entering a much nicer hotel.",

      "text": "I arrived at the Westin at 9am and asked if I could store my bag because it was too early to check in. The front desk host and bellman both told me a room was available and I could check in right away. The host asked for my ID and credit card. She confirmed that my room was prepaid and that I was an SPG member. I got my keys, thanked her and headed to my room. She didn't mention anything about the restaurant or other hotel services. The view from the room was great. High floor and quiet. I was grateful because it started to snow shortly after I got to my room. As I was looking around I noticed some things were not in the room: Minibar price list Room service menu (only a breakfast door hanger) Hotel/Room guide Channel guide Then I took a closer look. The bed linens don't fit the bed. The fitted sheets are only placed halfway on the mattress. The mattress is placed off kilter on the box spring. The pillowcases had tears. The extra comforter had a crusted stain. The box spring cover had a stain. The chair cushion had a stain. The desk chair had visible rips. The bathroom ceiling had a hair on it that definitely was not mine and the wine glasses did not match. All the coffee was decaf. To turn on the heater, you had to move the floor lamp which was right up against the thermostat. I did have a good nights sleep and found the pillows and towels very comfortable. I requested extra pillows and they were brought up right away. The following morning, two housekeepers were having a rather angry conversation in the hallway outside my room. This went on for about 20 minutes. I got dressed and left so they could hopefully get in my room and out of the hallway with their loud argument. As I left I said good morning to the housekeeper and another woman who was in a uniform suit who may have been a supervisor. The housekeeper asked me what room was I staying in. I told her the number and she said oh, the Asian lady is in there and she doesn't want her room cleaned. I told the housekeeper I was the only person in that room (I'm definitely not Asian). She then said my room had requested no cleaning and tried to show me her worksheet. I assured her I made no such request and asked if she could please clean my room. She was just two doors down and it was about 11:15am. The DND sign was not on my door. I returned to my room at approximately 2:15pm and it had not been touched. I gathered my dirty towels and a bag of trash and found another housekeeper down the hall. She was kind enough to give me some fresh towels and take my bag of trash. But she also asked me what room I was in and if I wanted my room cleaned. At 2:50pm, the housekeeper who I had spoken to earlier in the day knocked on my door and yelled, housekeeping. At that point, I just asked her for a packet of regular coffee for the morning. She then asked if she could use my phone to call in that she had cleaned my room and would I mind? I don't know why there was such confusion over whether or not my room was supposed to be serviced. I checked out on Monday, January 21st. The hosts attending the SPG line were busy looking at another employee's pictures on a cell phone. One of the women quickly checked me out and went right back to the photos. The bellman and doormen did not ask if I needed transportation to the airport. No one said goodbye.",

      "text": "Well, where do I start ?. I had high expectations after staying in a number of Westin\u2019s globally however, I\u2019m afraid I left my stay at the Westin Grant Central NYC a very unhappy and frustrated customer. Firstly, I had booked here with a group attending a conference in NYC, so all up there were 12 of us staying for periods between 4 and 8 nights, so I figure just based on the room rate we were charged the bill was USD$70,000 plus meals, drinks, dry cleaning etc.. etc.. Not to say I was expecting anything \u201camazing\u201d, but an adequate service would have been nice. First impressions are good, an ok location in mid-town, not too far from Grand Central Terminal. The hotel is reasonably modern and well accessible. The check in process was ok, albeit there were only 2 clerks on duty and a 20 minute wait after a long flight was a drag. the check-in staff were not overly friendly or warm, and I really detected an air of indifference in their attitude. Anyway, after what seemed an extensive wait we received our key and made our way to the 14th floor. The luggage arrived not long thereafter and we provided the porter the customary tip. Seeing we had just arrived at JFK with no opportunity to exchange currency, we offered an AUD 5 dollar note. The porter seemed miffed at this, scoured and left with barely an acknowledgement\u2026\u2026 geez, sorry I didn\u2019t anticipate the inconvenience I was going to cause the porter by not thinking ahead and exchanging some currency !. As you do after being out of contact for some 24 hours, I logged on to the guest wireless internet. This is expensive at USD$15 + taxes per device per day. As my partner and I had a Blackberry, Iphone, Laptop and Ipad between us, this proved to be an expensive option. There were no discount plans available for 3 day/7 day plans either. This is quite a scam if you ask me as wireless is readily available for free around NYC. The rooms themselves are functional. The beds are great, as I\u2019ve come to expect with the Westin\u2019s I\u2019ve stayed in. The LCD screen is huge and provides a wide range of free to air and pay options. The bathroom is adequate, but a little on the small side and you could not accommodate 2 persons in there at the same time. A pet hate are the fabric shower screens which I personally find a little unhygienic. We slept well, and ventured out the next day to do some exploring. Upon arriving back at the room at 4pm, the room hadn\u2019t been attended to. A call to reception fixed this, but hey\u2026. should I have to remind them of this ?. We also noticed that the little things went unnoticed, the tissue box in the bathroom remained empty for days, toilet paper was left to run low etc. On the second last day we had left a laundry bag with a few basics to be laundered and a tie to be dry-cleaned. They forgot to collect the laundry and we had to remind housekeeping later in the day when we returned to the room. No apology, but they said they would try and return our laundry by 5pm the next day, even though it was a Saturday. Well, the laundry returned, and I don\u2019t want to seem picky but everything was individually hung and plastic wrapped. I personally think this is excessive and the hotel should re-think it\u2019s green credentials. My main beef was that the underwear and 3 blouses plus 1 tie came to USD$120 + taxes. Please\u2026\u2026 I would rather an $80 service with less plastic !... ohh, and the tie came back from being dry cleaned with a stain clearly still evident. The disaster in the hotel which will be this properties undoing is the dining room. Faulty Towers has nothing on this place. Where do I start ?. Firstly I will acknowledge that the dining room and bar are recently opened, and as some reviewers have mentioned, the hotel had no dining/bar options for some time, so this must be an improvement\u2026. perhaps\u2026 ? The breakfast offered at the dining room is very basic. It consists of a buffet that comprises the following \u2013 3 types of cereals, 2 types of flavoured yoghurts, fresh fruit (blueberries, strawberries, bananas), hot options (scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, sausages, roast potatoes), Muffins, breakfast bread rolls. The food didn\u2019t look particularly appetising and at USD $25 each + taxes and service, it was poor value for money. They make it very clear that this is a buffet and that they don\u2019t do a-la-carte, but if you ask, they will \u201csometimes\u201d accommodate your requests. The weird part is that that have a chef on attendance at the buffet (all decked out in high peak chef\u2019s hat etc) and his primary role is to stir the eggs in the server. This was weird as when I asked him for some toast, he looked at me with a blank expression and he said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t serve\u201d, and motioned me towards a waiter. I still can\u2019t quite figure out what his role was ?. I think my main complaint with this restaurant was the service. The wait staff were down right rude. For example ; My partner was up at the buffet selecting some food and when the waiter came by to serve some coffee, I also ordered a green tea for my partner. 2 minutes later my partner sat down and decided that rather than green tea, she wanted Calm tea (a mixture of chamomile tea and other leafs). Five minutes later, the green tea arrived and when we enquired about the Calm tea, we were greeted with a scorn, and told that it was too late, as it had already been made !!... lol On our last day we attended the buffet again and after being seated, we enquired if it was possible to get a side of smoked salmon. We were greeted with scorn at this request by the waiter and reminded of the no a-la-carte rule, but he would do his best. 20 mins later he returned to confirm that the chef would \u201cmake some\u201d. When I politely enquired why the chef was required to \u201cmake\u201d a side portion of smoked salmon, I was given some flippant comment that \u201cit doesn\u2019t appear on the plate by itself\u201d and that it takes preparation etc. Anyway another 10 minutes elapsed and we were presented with some smoked salmon, bagels, cream cheese, onions and capers\u2026\u2026. Now I know why the chef was required to \u201cmake it\u201d, but this was quite different to what I had ordered. If only the waiter had explained this, there wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. At an adjacent table, the waiter was berating a customer for allowing their 5 yo girl to pick at a plate of food when she hadn\u2019t paid for the service \u2026. Seriously, the food is average and over-priced and why would you bother making a big deal of this\u2026 and particularly in middle of service, embarrassing the customer and making the other guests feel uncomfortable. And finally, after breakfast we went back to the room and then went to check out. Upon checking the bill, I noticed that the breakfast hasn\u2019t been included. I advised the clerk of this, and he phoned the dining area to see if he could get the charge posted. After 2 attempts and 5 minutes of waiting on the call for them to answer, I went to the restaurant myself to ask if they could post the charge. The restaurant was empty and I was told that by one of the SEVEN staff that it\u2019s not normal practice to do this until end of shift ??. By this stage they could see I was getting irate and the Supervisor came across and attended to my request for me (how hard is It to request that I be charged !!). I went back to the front desk and he then proceeded to check me out and rolled his eyes muttering something about the poor restaurant\u2026\u2026\u2026 clearly I wasn\u2019t the only unhappy customer. Any finally, upon checking out, I was on a 2 pm flt, my partner on a 6pm one, so I asked for a late check-out (no problems there). The only problem was that once they did this, the internet was cancelled and despite renewing the service earlier that day for their daily flat charge, we needed to do it again. In summary, this is a hotel with lots of potential, but lacking in service ethos. The dining room is a joke and they need to re-visit this from scratch. I would not stay here again. There is no way my Co. will be sending $70K here again, there are other hotels in NYC that would like our custom I\u2019m sure.",

I am a long curly haired black woman so that didn't come from my head. I called and asked to speak with a manager and a man answered and told me he would sent someone up immediately. 25 minutes later no one in sight. I then called the managers office for another 10 minutes till finally a woman picked up. She had no clue of what man answered my request and I had to start over with my problem. I went back and forth with her for 45 minutes on the lack of communication, and how waiting now over an hour has caused me to miss my birthday dinner reservation the reason for this trip! During this conversation no house keeping person in sight. Finally I was asked to come to the bar to have a drink and talk to the manager in person. They offered dinner but I was terrified to have a side of hair in it and pissed for missing my plans because of such a dumb reason preventing me from getting ready.A cleaning lady came and verified for the manager that the bathroom was dirty as if they thought I made this up.Not naming names but the manager didn't have the nicest mannerism initially but ended up being very compassionate by time I departed my stay.

I am not sure what happened to the Westin Heavenly bed but for me it was not a heavenly night sleep.I see for overs after reading reviews that the beds are ok for them. Usually the Westin bed is fantastic, and thus is why I usually choose a Westin Hotel. The front desk staff were excellent and everyone was friendly. The location was good. The rooms were cleaned well, so day time housekeeping was fine. Night time was another story. Requested a bed sheet and extra blanket and I gave up waiting after one & a half hours and went to bed. Put the 'Do not disturb' sign on door and as I was sleeping the guy knocked on the door to deliver my blanket. Woke me up!!!

When they have two people in a room, it would be nice if they put two robes, but then again I probably could have requested that, I didn't bother. There are plugs on either side of the lamp near the bed, so both people can charge their phone beside them at bedtime. Starbucks coffee is offered for the coffee machine. One feature that was really interesting was the offer to rent workout clothes (for $5 I think) for those who don't have room in their luggage to bring sneakers, etc. If I was there longer I would have taken advantage of this offer. The shower is nice, it has both the rain shower head, and a separate hand held if needed. The hotel is located within easy walk of Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building, which I think is the most striking building in New York. For breakfasts, we ate at the Sandwicherie right next door to the hotel, so I cannot speak to the restaurants. We always went out for dinner. The one area where this hotel loses points is that the wifi is not free, you have to pay for it. We vacationed in the UK and France last year, and we are booked to go to Asia this year - everywhere we stayed or are going to stay has free wifi. I just stayed in a Comfort Inn in a small town in Ontario and they had free wifi. I feel that at this stage, any hotel that charges for wifi is making a money grab. I read further and it said that if you are part of their SPG network and you book on their SPG website you get free wifi. I am a SPG member but I did not make the booking. We were in a group and I did not know who or how the room was booked. When I called to the front desk to enquire, I was offered no advice about how to get wifi other than to pay for it. That's one area that needs to be simpler for the customer. If you don't care about wifi access or get it free because you are booking it, I would give it four points, but for my experience it gets three points.",

Mistake booking on my phone. - Realized mistake when using mobile check in. Tried to fix by calling front desk. Could not get to the front desk after 10+ attempts. Left voicemail at 8:30pm. - Called Elite reservation line for help. Person was great and agreed to try to move our reservation but needed agreement from Grand Central or we risk no show fee. Elite line couldn't get to a person as well. We agreed to just stay there. - Tried calling again, asked F**** what we can do. He just transfers us to a line that goes to voicemail. He said he knows and other people complain as well. - Arrived 11:45PM. Two ladies at the front desk. Asked why no front desk phone service. One person spoke up to say it goes to voicemail. I told her I know and left a message 3 hours ago. Was told after she walked away she was the front desk manager. - Check in complete.....3820 here we come. View is great. Room is fine. Breakfast next morning...... - No consistent story on how to benefit from the Elite allowance and use the credit from the $28 Destination Fee. - First receipt was wrong, corrected it after back and forth to front desk. - Could have told us Continental breakfast was to the right, sit down to the left. - We didn't need a $90.46 breakfast before Elite discount. - Front desk said DF credit will be applied at check out. Day 2 - Same but found out Continental service was to the right, full service to the left. - Down a person, Only $70 on the 2nd day before credits. Check out - - W** asked if I wanted printed or emailed. Told him both. - Reviewed 1st copy and asked where the $70 DF credit was? Doesn't know and said sometimes it doesn't appear. No problem he tells me and I'll enter it. What about the other 100 guests that day that didn't read their bill? - Then I see a line for \"Room Revenue\".....another $15.91 per day. He said it was a tax? I told him a see lines for tax and it's not labeled \"tax\" it's labeled revenue. No response. - My view is the front desk staff that I interacted with reflects the personality of the manager I engaged with at check in. Join the incorrect charges and lack of warmth at the front desk and I would rather not have stayed here. Someone at corporate should try to call the front desk. I stayed at the Courtyard nearby last year....top notch! Hotel can look up my stay and call if they would like to discuss. It was just one opinion.",

      "text": "We stayed for 6 days in New York City at the Hampton Times Square North. It is the perfect place to stay. Located at 54th and 8th ave it is central to all of the must see places in Manhattan. The hotel pictures are accurate. Very attractive, clean, and well maintained. A must for me is WiFi in the room and it should be free and this Hampton has it . You can ask for it upon check in or at anytime. Hot full breakfast is one of the reasons we stay at Hampton Inns and this hotel has a good one. In NY that is a $30 value for two people. The manager must be excellent because the staff is pleasant, helpful, and appropriate in every way. Staff does reflect management. I talked to another tourist who was staying elsewhere and he complained about his hotel staff and how unfriendly and unhelpful they were. There is plenty of that kind of hotels in every city, but this Hampton Inn and every one that I have stayed at are well run and very friendly and helpful and this one meets that high standard. It even has a physical fitness gym. Our room faced West and that is much quieter than facing 8th avenue. NY is a very noisy city. Next door were young girls who talked and giggled past midnight and you could hear them quite clearly. Room to room sound proofing needs to be improved. Another TripAdviser reviewer also said that. The hotel windows are double pained glass and that is a must for any hotel in New York. Near is a drug store, and on 9th avenue are grocery stores. Places to eat are everywhere. But eat at places on 9th avenue because that serves the people who live in the neighborhood and the restranuts are great, and less expensive than on 8th avenue that serves the tourists. For our first night we eat at a French restraunt that was excellent named Marseille at 44th and 9th. You do need reservations, which we made that afternoon. It was $120 with tip but well worth it on 9th there are many types of food and at a much less price. We ate at the \u201cEatery\u201d on 9th and about 54th for lunch and at about 9th and 45th is Five Napkin Hamburger, which is great. Out first morning we walked over the G Washington Bridge. The views back to Manhattan are beautiful. It is quiet, you can hear the birds, nice neighborhoods, and walk on river path back to the bridge. Check out Samantha Brown\u2019s things to do in Brooklyn. Read about the bridges history and that of Brooklyn. It is an exciting and beautiful thing to do. Just down on 46th street between 8th & 9th is a place that has easy jazz music and a dance floor. Its name is SWING 46. We went there and danced and had a good time. Do not eat there. There are so many good restaurants near that SWING 46 should be the last stop of the evening Day two we went to the TENEMENT MUSEUM. This is a must. They have several different tours based upon nationality. We took the Irish one. It\u2019s at 108 Orchard Street down on the tip of the island. It shows you how people lived or were treated like animals before we had sanitation and other laws. Without business regulations and other laws people take advantage of and mistreat people. Sadly, but truly, it is a fiction that most people will do what is right, without laws. While you are in that area, plan on seeing that museum about 2 p.m. and then have an early dinner at a Moroccan restaurant called Cage Gitane at 242 Mott Street, just a short walk. WARNING: Out of 9 million people there are bad people and also in your town. I over heard a lady complaining about her wallet just being stolen. When I looked at her purse she had a big open top purse. That is inviting thievery. Also a man told me that his wallet was picked. Men, put your wallet in the front pocket and your hand on it when in a crowd. Women should only carry a small and zipped purses. Criminals are every where and you should not make it easy for them. Big purses and wallets in the back pocket only invite crime. As an aside, I have seem more rude, inconsiderate, demanding travelers than I have ever seen rude hotel or tourist workers. Lets expect good service, but lets be good travelers. BE PREPARED: More and more places to eat and stores are CASH ONLY. You can order a nice meal and find that you must pay in cash and not have cash. Apparently credit cards are charging the merchant too much money to cash the credit slip and many places have stopped taking credit cards. Also, an oddity is many places ONLY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS, and not Visa or MasterCard. I got caught with this one. Everyone at dinner had to come up with cash. It does say on the menu, in small print, AMERICAN EXPRESS only. I have decided to not shop or eat at places that do not take MasterCard or Visa. I am a world traveler and have never had these problems in Paris or London or Stockholm where they all took my MasterCard. TRANSPORT: We were in NY for 6 days. We got a card from the subway that was good there and on the bus. This was very helpful. The cost to and from the airport is about $40 with tip. Town cars are a nice luxury",

Housekeeping was dependable, friendly, and performed their duties well. The beds were comfortable. We were on the 11th floor overlooking 8th Avenue; my wife, who is a light sleeper, never commented on any street noise. ELEVATORS: Very efficient -- never an unreasonable wait STAFF: Pleasant, helpful, and accommodating INTERNET ACCESS: If you don\u2019t have your computer with you, the hotel provides two computers with printers off the lobby. The cost is included in the price of the room. There is a 10-minute time limit before you are logged out -- a good policy that prevents discourteous guests from treating them like their personal machines. SECURITY: I noticed no security cameras in the hallways and elevators. A security guard checks room keys after 9 PM, but no one was checking on Friday/Saturday nights when we went to our room. In any event, the checking of room keys is not very effective. Instead of turning in the plastic key card when one checks out, an ill-intentioned person can retain it and use it to show the key checker when he wishes to access the room areas at night. FOOD: Like all Hampton Inns at which I\u2019ve stayed, the guests have access to a buffet breakfast which is built into the price of the room. Cereal, sausage, eggs/French toast/waffles, yogurt, breads, bagels, pastries, fruit, milk, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea are standard. The breakfast crew does an excellent job restocking. In addition, apples, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea are available at any time in the lobby [as are cookies if you time it right]. When looking at the price of the room, be sure to consider how much money these food features will save you. All-in-all, a well run hotel in a great location which offers you value for your money.",

      "text": "I was traveling with a large group but we all made our reservations separately. We knew we would be arriving early in day and would need somewhere to store our bags prior to Check in at 3 pm. I spoke to the hotel directly about a week prior and verified about holding my luggage. I mentioned I was traveling with a group (iI don\u2019t remember who I spoke with) they verified it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Three other people in our group (and it was a large group) also called and verified same thing. None of us were asked how many were in the group. I also spoke to the diamond desk on Tuesday prior to our Friday stay to verify some information on the two rooms I reserved. The diamond desk also said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for me to leave my luggage until my room was ready. I mentioned to her also I was traveling with a group. When we arrived, our room was not ready (as we knew it wouldn\u2019t be). A small part of our group had their luggage held and then the hotel ran out of room for the remainder of the rest of us to store luggage. Our team director (we were there for a gymnastics competition) spoke with the manager several times trying to find a solution. I did not speak to him directly, but when I went to the front desk to try and inquire about storing our bags, I was interrupted before I could finish my question and told \u201cthe manager is finding a place to put the luggage\u201d. After much commotion in the lobby with lots of folks and their luggage (and persistence from our team director) the manager was able to get one room cleaned (which ended up being our team directors room). We filled her entire room with our luggage for storage that day. We appreciated them getting a room ready for us to do that. However, I wish the manager had said \u201cwe are going to find a solution for you\u201d instead of repeatedly telling her he \u201cdidn\u2019t know when a room would be available, there was no more space for luggage, we should have notified them ahead,\u201d etc etc. And one of them employees said (out loud) that our team director had \u201can attitude\u201d as they were walking past me (which I found to be very unprofessional). I know everyone was frustrated on both sides. We had some families that had half their luggage stored and part of it not stored. No one could go see the city and do anything other than stand in the lobby until we had a resolution. It took about an hour. But we finally got it worked out and were on our way. When I checked in, I asked that I receive a phone call when our rooms were ready because I knew we would be touring the city but staying close by to get settled in our rooms. I verified my phone number with staff at check in but never received that call. When we got back at 4, our room of course was ready, but I kept waiting for that call earlier in day so we could and get our luggage out of our team directors\u2019 room. The room was very spacious. I had the king study. Very clean. Bathroom is smaller than I\u2019m used to in other Hilton properties, but very doable and I was expecting it to be a little small bc it\u2019s New York. We had two people in Our room. My other room was two queen beds and had two people. Very clean as well. The hallways were very hot the first two days, but then got better. Breakfast had plenty to offer, but go early bc it is so crowded. I liked being able to have things like bananas and yogart to take with us if needed. The hotel has a great location. Very close walking distance to Times Square and broadway shows. We used the concierge once to ask about getting a young lady a transfer to the airport (traveling alone). We were told \u201cyour best best is a taxi or uber\u201d. We knew about those already, so nothing extra helpful there. Upon checkout, my second reservation received express check out, but my own personal room did not. I ended up checking out at the desk, which I don\u2019t mind, but as a diamond member I usually get express checkout for any reservation. The hotel was in a great location. The rooms are spacious and clean. I would stay here again for the rooms. I wasn\u2019t impressed with the staff. Their customer service left a lot to be desired compared to my experiences at other Hilton properties.",

      "text": "Booked this hotel for one night directly through Hilton's website, at a rate of USD 229 ++. This is one of my all time favourite hotels. It is simply a great hotel. I have stayed at many top ends hotels around the world, and even though Hampton would not be able to compete in the same segment as FS or MO, I must say that the unpretentious level of service and the lavish rooms are highly comparable to the snobby service and tired rooms of many of the top luxury hotels. I was checked-in early by a nice receptionist. The doorstaff took care of my luggage. My room was large and modern, it had a great and comfortable bed, sufficient lighting, a large LCD tv, a laptop safe, walk-in closet, a comfortable desk and ergonomical chair, a cosy chair and footrest. The bathroom was large and had a lot of quality amenities. The bathtub was large enough and the water pressure from the shower head were okey (could have been stronger, but not really a problem). I stayed on several hotels in New York during this trip: two nights at the Westin and three nights at the Sheraton Towers. Unfortunately I stayed only one night at the Hampton, because it was my last night in New York. Hampton were way better than the Westin and the Sheraton, both in terms of service/staff friendliness and in terms of room quality/amenities. I was so surprised by this, and I do wish all Hamptons could be like this one. Every staff member were warm, friendly and smiling - those includes the door staff, the elevator staff, the breakfast staff, the front desk staff, the housekeeping staff and so on. They provide a casual and comfortable atmosphere to the hotel. One of the managers called to my room to hear if everything were fine and in order. This usually happens in high end hotels only. I was pleasantly surprised to experience this in a Hampton Inn! There was complientary wireless internet throughout the hotel, complimentary local calls, complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolate both in the rooms and in the lobby (a very nice feature), complimentary apples, complimentary newspaper delievered to the room and complimentery buffet breakfast. The breakfast was not my style of breakfast - only sweet things like cookies, donuts, cakes....not very healthy. There was a very limited selection of fruits and yoghurt. But it was all complimentary, so I can't complain about it. Starbucks and Subway were just across the street. Great location too!! One block from Times Square. I will return to this hotel anytime!!!

From cruise ship terminal 5mins $6 taxi ride plus tip (take yellow meter taxi from taxi stand accoss the terminal) or 10 mins $12 taxi ride from Penn Train Staion. Check in/out was very smooth and painless. Our room wasn't ready since we arrived before check in time but it was no problem for us as they can store our luggage and there are plenty of attractions/sights and cafe/restaurants available within walking distance. We walked every where (even my 68years old mother in law) to Central Park, Empire State Building, Top of Rock, etc. Times Square is just 2blocks away and felt very safe to even walk around by myself at late evening (female). E line train station is 1 block away at 50th and 8th ave, and very convenience to go lower Manhattan area. $2.25 train ride to 911 memorial and wall street. As you know by now, you cannot beat this location! 2Queen Size Room Pro: Spacious for 3 adults and comfortale queen size bed. Complimentary use of room safe, wi-fi (good connection), and local calls. No sign of bed bugs. Room Con: Moldy bathroom and dirty shower head. (I contacted both front desk and house keeping in regard to moldy bathroom and dirty shower head but no action or apology from the hotel. I even left extra tips to house keeper with specific note to clean the shower head but they did not change or clean the shower head even I reminded them several times during our stay) Very disappointed especially we paid over $1100 for 3 nights (avarage $300/nights). My friends stayed 10 blocks down the street at Distrikt Hotel at same rate and there where no compareson in terms of cleanliness and attention to details in the room amenities and service. paper cups to use in the room and no fridge to chill your drinks. Hotel Service Pro: This hotel provide complimentary use of internet station (computer with printer), continental breakfast or grab to go breakfast bag. Complimentary drink station available 24/7 with coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Hotel Service Con: Hotel concierge and some of the front desk staff has no idea of popular sightseeing information and location. In fact, both concierge and front desk staff gave us completely different direction and either of them were wrong and this happend twice druing our stay which cause us some problem. Do NOT waste your time asking to concierge or hotel front desk, instead use their complimentary internet service to search for yourself. Overall, this hotel is excellent location, spacious room, and great internet connection. However, not worse paying over $300 for moldy bathroom and dirty shower. Made our stay very uncomfortable and not satisfied due to bathroom issue. I complaint during our stay and at the time of check out but they seems did not take my complaint seriously. I still haven't receive any follow up or apology from the hotel. (We stayed Room 912, Nov 6-9, 2011) We will only consider going back to this hotel if they clean the bathroom and change the shower head!",

      "text": "This hotel was adequate but I was expecting great things after all the brilliant reviews on trip advisor. Our main gripe was that although we booked a room for three of us (two of us intending to share a king size bed and the remaining person on a sofabed) when we arrived the sofabed wasn't made up as a bed (although the hotel knew to expect three people). When we tried to make the sofabed up we couldn't get the sofabed to fold out due to the layout of the other furniture in the room. We phoned reception who sent up a maintenance man who said he couldn't help us due to the kingsize bed being nailed to the floor. In the end we managed to get the bed to unfold but only after we had hauled very heavy furniture about the room ourselves. Then it transpired there was no duvet for the sofabed and only one pillow - we had to phone reception again to get proper bedclothes. Then on the second day when our beds were made up the maid (very strangely) took the sheet off the kingsize bed meaning we had to sleep right next to the duvet (which I don't like the idea of given that duvets are not changed with every traveller). We had to phone reception to get the sheet back! On another occasion the maid just didn't make up the bed (she had been in the room but I think didn't make up the bed because there were items on it). Sorry if the foregoing is a bit pedantic but the hotel did know there would be 3 of us sharing a room and the missing sheet was just strange. The hotel was clean enough, in a good location and the free breakfast was good but the hotel make a big song and dance about how they want your stay to be 100% and on this occasion I'm afraid it wasn't. The phone in our room also broke and the maintenance man just said he couldn't fix it, although it did start working again a couple of days later.",

      "text": "We won a trip to NYC through our local AAA and a local television station. It included airfare and a $500 hotel voucher (for any hotel) for two nights. We decided to make a mini family vacation out of it and bought a third ticket for my daughter and added a night for 3 nights in NYC. (ended up being four because airline blackout date required us to fly in the night before, but we stayed at the airport Hampton that night to save some money since it was a Saturday night.) After much research on Trip Advisor and other sites, I had narrowed my choices down to this Hampton and one other hotel. Our AAA office TA then found a deal for us to stay at the Marriott Marquis right in Times Square for over $200 less than staying in this hotel. (total for the 3 nights) We wrestled with which hotel to stay in... right in the heart of Times Square or a few blocks away (plus & minus to both); size of hotel, 200 rooms vs. 2000 rooms; no breakfast plus pay internet at the Mariott; Free Breakfast & Internet at Hampton; past good experiences with Hampton Hotels; past reviews on TA, etc.. In the end we decided that, in spite of being over $200 more for the 3 nights, the Hampton was the better way to go. We were proven right! (we did tour the Mariott Hotel while we were there to see...). The Hampton is in a great location.... near Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, Central Park, the theaters WITHOUT being in the middle of the mess. I can't imagine trying to sleep or get in and out of the Mariott based on the business of Times Square at all hours!. Rooms: The room was a good size. Plenty of room for the three of us and all of our stuff. Nice closet, queen beds, flat screen tv, desk, etc. Most hotels in that area only offer two double beds instead of two queens, another plus for the Hampton. The drapes were fine and did a great job of keeping street lighting out. Noise was sometimes an issue even though we were on the 8th floor (out of 11). Mostly from fire trucks and some night time semis. Not really a big deal however. It was easy to regulate the temperature in the room in spite of being over 90 outside. Beds were comfortable like all Hampton beds. Pay movies and games available although we did not use that feature. Internet was a wired internet, but the wire was provided. Could sit at desk and work just fine. Room was clean. (carpets, drapes, beds). As others have pointed out, the bathroom may seem a big smaller than other Hamptons, but it was fine. The shelving under the sink is extremely handy for keeping clean towels, toiletries and toiletry bags. Elevators were somewhat slow especially when you called one from the 8th floor...you usually had a 3 minute wait, but it is a busy hotel. Waiting at the bottom would be a while during peak times. Nothing to really complain about. Hallways were well lit and clean... very plain hallways... but who cares? Who spends time in the halls....lol. Breakfast was a typical Hampton Breakfast. Plenty of items to choose from and a very attentative young man who took care of it. Nothing seemed to bother him. One lady knocked the lid of the fruit bowl on the floor...not once, but twice! Each time the breakfast attendant, scooped it up and disapeared with it to the back to wash the cover and brought it back quickly. No stares or grumbling toward the stupid woman. (there I said it for him....lol). There are two sections to dine in, both with their own TV's. They have a sign that gives the times for breakfast and how busy it is. (don't remember the exact times but there were three catagories... \"Quiet Breakfast,\" \"Busy Breakfast\" and \"Tumultuous Breakfast\" (don't hear that work too often...lol). We ate as late as 8:00 p.m. over the 3 days and never found it overly crowded. Always plent of seats. One complaint would be the last morning. The hot item choices was \"western omlet\" and \"seasoned potatoes.\" I found that I couldn't eat either one as I can't eat alot of seasoned foods. Perhaps not putting those two items together in the future might be a good idea. During breakfast hours, they have a coffee station in the breakfast room and another in the lobby. That way those just wanting coffee or tea don't have to come in the breakfast room. The lobby coffee/tea station is available 24 hours a day. The other public areas were small... small lobby waiting area, small fitness room and extremely small \"business center. To make any of those areas larger, they would have had to shrink the breakfast area. Just fine the way it is. There is a small gift/supply shop in the lobby. Actually good prices on many souvenier type gifts! Staff: everyone we encountered was excellent. We arrived from the airport Hampton earlier than expected (11:00 a.m.) and asked if we could check in. The man behind the counter said no problem and we took care of all the paperwork. He then told me that the only two queen room that he had was on the second floor facing the back and he asked if I wanted to wait for a better room, higher up. I said sure and he told me that he would get us a good room, higher up and facing the front. (better view.). He then had the bellman take all of our luggage and said they would store it at no charge until we returned. He then gave me a map of NYC and made some marks of a couple places to see that day. When we returned several hours later, he was gone but our room keys were ready and the clerk instructed the bellman to deliver our stored luggage directly to our room! I then asked about a good place to eat nearby and she suggested Rino Trattoria, just a few doors down. She was right! Great place (see seperate review). One afternoon when we returned to rest for a few minutes, we went in our room and about a minute later a knock came on our door. I answered it and it was the maid.... she simply wanted to let me know that my door hadn't closed all the way when we had entered. How very throughtful! How many others would have just left that and went on about their business. The Conceirge (Susan?) was fantastic. So friendly, joking and knowledgeable. She talked about many options with us and made our theater reservations.... she even joked with me when I came back to ask her what is appropriate to wear to the theater. The manager called and left a message the last night before we were to check out thanking us for our stay. Check out was fast and easy. One thing I do to determine how good a hotel really is, is to watch the staff interact with one another when not dealing with customers. A friendly staff to each other is a good staff I have found. Every time I snuck a look at them behind the Front Desk, they were smiling, joking with each other and basically appearing to enjoy their work. Means that the management makes it a good work enviroment. Like I said, I was extremely impressed with the Hampton Inn, Times Square North in every way... location, service, cleaniness, friendliness. The price may be a little high when I could have got the Mariott Marquis for a little less, but I still believe we made the right decision in choosing this hotel over the others. They made my first visit to NYC a good one. I do now plan to return to NYC sometime in the future and this hotel will be on my short list of places to look at staying.",

My family and some friends checked in several days early to enjoy the city before the rest of the tour came in even though there were several large groups check-in was painless we didn't have adjacent rooms like we agree quested but when we got to our room and had some issues with the view asI had an elderly person who was going to be staying in the room most of the week so she could have a better View and we were accommodated immediately. Staff at the front desk also made arrangements so that we would not need to change rooms when our tour group arrived. Due to health issues we were accommodated with a fan, a mini fridge, and coffee maker we even got a call making sure we got let me ask for and if we were satisfied. We cannot say more about the staff from the minute we checked in we were able to leave our bags and had a recommendation for a place to eat nearby from the Bellman and also a great recommendation as to where to stand for the Thanksgiving Day Parade viewing. I cannot give enough praise to Quimby in customer service he always greeted me everyday and inquired about my day activities when we came back from the Thanksgiving Day Parade Frozen he greeted us with offers of hot coffee or a bottle of water. Such a very kind man representing that property amazingly well he also told me the history of the hotel and what famous people used to stay there it was very interesting. Carmelo (I have misplaced his card) the doorman was wonderful. We became friendly also and I looked forward to seeing him and visiting with him even though I generally used Uber he still helped me watch for my car He did give us help and tips regarding the cabs as we did Dean ever use them a few times also. Several days I traveled solo he would always say make sure if I'm working you check back in with me so I know you're okay. They both made me feel like I was almost family for them. I would pick this hotel again just because of the level of service that they displayed. It's an excellent location very walkable to many of the areas people want to do in New York City. Have a wonderful Premier Deli across the street with excellent food and a block and a half down Applejack Diner and McGee's Pub were wonderful recommendations all by the staff. I feel I left friends at this hotel I hope to return to the city. Our room was large the bed was extremely comfortable. The only issue we had is it could use some brighter lighting. We did request an additional floor lamp and it was brought in so my elderly friend could read. if you're looking for locations close to Central Park it's very close and Time Squares about a ten-minute walk very safe area to explore and enjoy the neighborhood. I hope Quimby and Carmillo are well recognized for their quality Ambassador services at this hotel. Pardon that hat hair with Quimby, we just walked in from being frozen at the coldest Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City history LOL. Thanks from Fans from Kansas!",

We stay in NYC often but have never stayed at The Park Central so I checked the reviews first. We went with our 2 children, 9 and 15. I usually try to find rooms that offer space, more on that later. We checked in and went to our room, 608. The room itself was filthy, pics are shown. The window covering is just a plastic shade, ours had a cut through it which was clearly not going to block out any light. The bathroom door did not fit into the door frame and wouldn't stay closed. I called the front desk and they said someone from housekeeping would come up to fix the problems. After waiting a while we called down and said someone would have to fix them while we were out. We came back 2.5 hours later to find that nothing was done. We called the front desk and told them we needed to start getting ready for dinner. An engineer came up, looked at the door first and told us that the doors \"don't lock for safety reasons.\" Then he told us that it was the contractors fault for using the wrong size door and he couldn't fix it. He went to look at the shade while I called the front desk to tell them we weren't going to stay in a room without a bathroom door that closed. My husband asked him to speak to the front desk to tell them the problem and he dashed out of the room. The front desk said that they would called us back but we told them we would be in the lobby with our luggage so they could switch our room because it was now getting getting close to our dinner reservation and we still hadn't showered. The guest relations manager in the lobby said the hotel was full. I insisted they find a different hotel for us to stay in. They said since we booked with Expedia, they had no responsibility-however I paid the hotel directly, so they are responsible. I did call Expedia to complain and they offered to try to find us another room in another hotel. (While I was talking to Expedia The Park Central said the engineer would go back and fix the room. My husband went back to the room, no one ever went back, it remained empty.) While Expedia was looking for a hotel the guest relations manager told us that someone canceled their room and we could switch rooms. Because we needed to get ready right now we took the room, how could it be worse? This new room was right across from the elevator and guess what else we found out about the Park Central the windows of the hotel are not soundproof! That's right-you can every little noise outside your window all night long. Every honk, every conversation, every car backfiring-every single noise. Not to mention the elevator dinging and the conversations of the people coming in and out of the elevator all night. Our family got no sleep at all! Here are other things that stink about this hotel: the elevators: tiny and slow-you can easily wait 10 minutes for an elevator. The phone system: to reach the front desk you push zero wait through a whole message of how you have to push another number to reach the front desk. They have no doormen (the doors are automatic) or security in the lobby so people who are not guests feel free to sit in the lobby all over the couches and chairs. Their rooms could not be cheesier: the light bulb in the bathroom was buzzing and blinking with that old timey fluorescent thing. There's no robes, mini bar, fridge, curtains. It's the most very basic of basic hotel rooms, but they charge a mid range fee (plus a $30 facility fee). Here are 3 hotels that are way nicer that we have stayed at that are: roomier, nicer, cleaner, have much better teams and are in the same price range: The Benjamin (this an all suite), The Trump Soho (look for discounts, they are out there) and The Eventi.",

When we returned at 5:00pm our room had not been cleaned and there were no towels. We wanted to take showers before the opera, but the hotel was unable to give us that service. I called Guest Services, who could not comprehend the problem and were of no help. So I called the hotel General Manager and was told that the GM\u2019s office would take care of the problem, and going forward the GM would personally supervise services to my room. When I asked to speak with Don Fraser, the GM I was told that was not possible. The next day we arrived back in the room after being out all day and once again, the room was not fully made up and there were no pillowcases. So the GM was apparently unable once again, to find a way to supervise his own staff! I talked with GM\u2019s office and was told that he was happy I provided feedback regarding his lack of management after my call the day before. But he clearly could not offer basic room services. Management had absolutely no idea of what they were doing, and could not figure out how to clean our room unless I called the GM\u2019s office each day! So much for having the GM promise to supervise the housekeeping in my room. It became my job. So much for service\u2026shameful! There was no coffee maker in the room. There was no water in the room. Not only was service terrible but there was obviously a lack of procedures to remedy guest concerns.

As other guest reviews have also commented, only two were apparently available during my stay. And both were periodically unavailable due to the inability of the security system to read guest room keys. Throughout my stay full elevators had to be continually evacuated because of the failures of the security technology. So there were very long waits for the one operational elevator for all 935 rooms. Many people were complaining, but the problem persisted for three days. Totally unacceptable! When we could not get the elevator to work we had to go to the bar area to wait. When we went to the bar bathroom, the doors did not open, the toilets did not flush and there was no soap. Disgusting! Clearly the Park Central Hotel has service considerably below the level of a $30 country motel in every way possible. Most disturbing was the refusal of the General Manager to even constructively talk with me about these problems and discuss why he was not able to manage the property to provide even basic levels of service to his guests, such as flushing toilets, bathroom soap, pillow cases, towels, coffee makers, water, and working elevators. There are many fine choices for hotels in New York City. In spite of the patronizing comments being made by the General Manager of the Park Central, the service problems that have been going on for years at the hotel continue to be of major consequence and continue to not be remedied by the General Manager. The time for a change of hotel management is very long overdue. Until then, I can see no reason to ever consider staying at the Park Central Hotel.",

      "text": "The Park Central is definitely a mixed experience. If you\u2019re not familiar with NYC, it\u2019s a fabulous location - easy walk to Broadway, Central Park, west side, east side, etc. the lobby is lovely - bright and inviting. Contrary to a few negative reviews, I found all of the staff helpful and friendly. I had booked in advance for the rate that included the possibility of cancelling. 3 days before, when I knew I wouldn\u2019t need to cancel, I changed to a non-refundable rate for a significant savings and got a larger room. In fact, a nice sized room for NY, street view and higher level. Street noise and hallway noise were all acceptable. Now the negative and why I won\u2019t return. As stated on other reviews, the room doesn\u2019t feel clean. While the bed was clean and comfortable, the room felt musty and the bathroom had an odor. At first I thought maybe it was the plumbing, but I think it might have been dirty rags. Management needs to have the carpets cleaned well. There is what looks like dust on the floor by all of the walls. Also, it is strange that there is only one heavy, opaque window shade. With office buildings directly across the street, that means that the shade must be kept completely closed for privacy if you\u2019re light is on Most hotels have an additional curtain or shade that allows light to come in, but can be closed so people can\u2019t look in. It was also surprising that the lovely, large bar off of the lobby doesn\u2019t serve any food at all. However, there is a small take out cafe, but closes early. The elevator security is misleading. As long as one person uses a key to make the elevator work, you can go to any floor. At most hotels with an elevator key slot, a key is needed to get to each specific floor. Location - perfect Staff - responsive Noise level - good for NY Room size - good for NY Room cleanliness - needs improvement",

      "text": "I have NEVER been so disappointed in a hotel in my life!! HERE'S WHY! On July 24th a lightning strike burned my house down. Since then life has been rough to say the least as I\u2019m a single mother of twin 5 year old daughters. So, I booked a 4 night stay at Park Central Hotel (12/8/17-12/12/17) even though it wasn\u2019t really in the budget because I really wanted to surprise my daughters with an amazing Christmas time trip! I thought a few days of ice skating in Rockefeller Center and Macy\u2019s Santaland would be just what we needed to forget about having lost everything in our worlds. I thought, do it now, money is money, memories are forever. So I got down to the business of planning! I booked my stay online and specified I needed TWO QUEEN BEDS AND A ROLLAWAY. Then I called because I wanted to make sure we got a rollaway and I knew that was a request only item and this trip was VERY important to me! They confirmed all was great and the notes were on my reservations, they said \u201cmake sure you call the hotel directly just in case.\u201d So I DID! I called the hotel DIRECTLY! Spoke to the HOTEL STAFF DIRECTLY and confirmed TWO QUEEN BEDS AND A ROLLAWAY! I felt confident and went about making reservations for the rest of the trip. Fast forward to arriving at the hotel. We walk up to the desk with my, now exhausted, twin 5 year old daughters in tow, at around 6:30pm. The RUDE woman at the desk says that she has me down for two queen beds. I remind her of the rollaway I\u2019ve called about and she says \u201cno way ma\u2019am, that\u2019s a fire hazard, you can\u2019t have a rollaway in ANY of those rooms\u201d. WHAT!!! I tell her I\u2019ve called the hotel DIRECTLY and they\u2019ve told me that it\u2019s on my reservation and won\u2019t be a problem at all. HERE IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY! She says \u201cyes ma\u2019am I can see that you called, I have that here, but we can\u2019t put a rollaway in those rooms so it\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s a fire hazard.\u201d Again, WHAT!!!! So I tell her I need the bed and they already confirmed it, if it couldn\u2019t be done then they SHOULD have told me ON THE PHONE. I tell her they need to put us in a room with enough space and she says \u201csorry, we\u2019re fully booked.\u201d Agaaain, WHAT!!!!! I am about to cry at this point because I\u2019ve literally used all the money I have to take my daughters on this trip and we are now in New York and it is too late to undo anything and she says \u201cyou can have a breakfast voucher.\u201d !!!!! WHAAAAT!!! The voucher that pays for a muffin and a juice! REALLY! The room was $450 a NIGHT!!!! So when I start to freak out she says \u201clook I can move you to a queen bed with a pull out couch, we can fit a rollaway in there.\u201d I tell her if that\u2019s the case I need to have my room fee adjusted because I paid for two BEDS, not a bed and a old couch, and she smirks and says \u201cno. That\u2019s a suite, your lucky we can even put you in that.\u201d I WAS SO UPSET!!! She did not care at all! NOT AT ALL! No apology! NOTHING! I asked if they could apply an active duty military discount (my travel companion had his ID present for them to view if needed) to offset costs and she laughed and ignored me! So...what? You also don\u2019t care about the military?? I was desperately trying to fix what YOUR STAFF had ROYALLY messed up and was getting mocked in the process! I gave up and spent the next 20 minutes waiting for one of the TWO elevators that service all the floors of your hotel to have room to carry us to our 6th floor \u201csuite\u201d with one bed, a pullout, a rollaway and a $450 a night price tag. (Oh and I didn\u2019t even get the \u201cbreakfast\u201d, the RUDE woman in the HORRIBLY OVERPRICED shop said I couldn\u2019t have \u201cthat muffin\u201d bc it \u201cwasn\u2019t covered by the voucher\u201d and I \u201chad to choose from those ones\u201d so I got mad and gave up.) Well, Park Central. You should be ASHAMED of yourself!! Your behavior and treatment of my family and I makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH! I hope that those among you that own and operate your facility never find yourself standing in front of your home watching everything you love and worked so hard to acquire burn to ash in front of you! And I hope than that if it does, when you finally see a crack of light peeking through the clouds, there isn\u2019t a smirking rude monster of a business that doesn\u2019t care about its customers AT ALL waiting to crush you even further down. You took $2000 dollars from me and I slept on a piece of garbage uncomfortable old pullout for four days. My only question: ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?!",

      "text": "I decided to treat my husband to a weekend in NYC for his birthday. I made reservations at The Park Central and dinner reservations for that night. We stay in NYC often but have never stayed at The Park Central so I checked the reviews first. We went with our 2 children, 9 and 15. I usually try to find rooms that offer space, more on that later. We checked in and went to our room, 608. The room itself was filthy, pics are shown. The window covering is just a plastic shade, ours had a cut through it which was clearly not going to block out any light. The bathroom door did not fit into the door frame and wouldn't stay closed. I called the front desk and they said someone from housekeeping would come up to fix the problems. After waiting a while we called down and said someone would have to fix them while we were out. We came back 2.5 hours later to find that nothing was done. We called the front desk and told them we needed to start getting ready for dinner. An engineer came up, looked at the door first and told us that the doors \"don't lock for safety reasons.\" Then he told us that it was the contractors fault for using the wrong size door and he couldn't fix it. He went to look at the shade while I called the front desk to tell them we weren't going to stay in a room without a bathroom door that closed. My husband asked him to speak to the front desk to tell them the problem and he dashed out of the room. The front desk said that they would called us back but we told them we would be in the lobby with our luggage so they could switch our room because it was now getting getting close to our dinner reservation and we still hadn't showered. The guest relations manager in the lobby said the hotel was full. I insisted they find a different hotel for us to stay in. They said since we booked with Expedia, they had no responsibility-however I paid the hotel directly, so they are responsible. I did call Expedia to complain and they offered to try to find us another room in another hotel. (While I was talking to Expedia The Park Central said the engineer would go back and fix the room. My husband went back to the room, no one ever went back, it remained empty.) While Expedia was looking for a hotel the guest relations manager told us that someone canceled their room and we could switch rooms. Because we needed to get ready right now we took the room, how could it be worse? This new room was right across from the elevator and guess what else we found out about the Park Central the windows of the hotel are not soundproof! That's right-you can every little noise outside your window all night long. Every honk, every conversation, every car backfiring-every single noise. Not to mention the elevator dinging and the conversations of the people coming in and out of the elevator all night. Our family got no sleep at all! Here are other things that stink about this hotel: the elevators: tiny and slow-you can easily wait 10 minutes for an elevator. The phone system: to reach the front desk you push zero wait through a whole message of how you have to push another number to reach the front desk. They have no doormen (the doors are automatic) or security in the lobby so people who are not guests feel free to sit in the lobby all over the couches and chairs. Their rooms could not be cheesier: the light bulb in the bathroom was buzzing and blinking with that old timey fluorescent thing. There's no robes, mini bar, fridge, curtains. It's the most very basic of basic hotel rooms, but they charge a mid range fee (plus a $30 facility fee). Here are 3 hotels that are way nicer that we have stayed at that are: roomier, nicer, cleaner, have much better teams and are in the same price range: The Benjamin (this an all suite), The Trump Soho (look for discounts, they are out there) and The Eventi.",

      "title": "Great place!",
      "text": "Spent 3 nights here on a recent (October) leisure trip to NYC. Chose the place based on tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. Here are the main points: LOCATION - it is ok. Yes, the hotel is right next to PABT, the parole office and there are a few shady looking places on 40th street as you walk towards 8th Av. BUT - there are a couple more nice hotels right next door (eg. 4 points), the street is quiet, the parolees are only around during the day and you might pass them occasionally on your way, at the most. Trust me, they are not interested in you. The hotel is between 9th and 8th Av. 9th westward is Hell's Kitchen - a more 'colorful' area, not as pretty, clean and 'new' as 8th Av and the area around Bryant Park. The New York Times building is right around the corner on 8th. You are right next door to the hustle and bustle. Sure, it's not as fancy as some areas around Bryant, but it's ok. And it is safe. If you have any concerns about that, please don't. I walked back to the hotel every night with no issues. The city never sleeps, there are plenty of people around and I felt very safe. AMENITIES - the hotel is small. If you are looking for a place that has a great lobby, several bars, restaurants, space to hang around, get pampered at the spa, etc., this is NOT the place for you. If, however, you are looking for a fresh, young, clean, simple (but good simple) place to stay and be your home base for exploring the city, this is IT. CLEAN, quiet, well-sized rooms (there were 3 of us), comfy beds, attentive and friendly staff, computer access in the lobby, free Wi-Fi, free snacks and drinks during happy hour, in-room tea and coffee replenished daily, free refreshments in the lobby (they have to-go cups). Did I mention it is super clean? VALUE - great! I booked with a 20% discount. That put me at around $1300 for 3 nights. It might seem steep, but it's NYC! You are a 10 minute walk from Times Square and Broadway, right next to Bryant Park and Parson's New School of Design (Project Runway :-). Got the discount on this webpage. ACCESS TO DINING - good. Several places to grab a bite - my favorite was the Paris bakery - right across from Parson's. Check it out - you won't regret it! If you need a late snack or water, etc., there is a Duane Reade pharmacy (walgreens) right around the corner on 8th ave. Pizza sold by the slice on the corner of 40th and 9th. Hotel has a small restaurant. Did not eat there, as I preferred to eat while out on the town, but heard it was good. OVERALL - Awesome place to stay. Would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone! Thank you, Distrikt Hotel!!!",

      "text": "Myself and my partner came to NYC to celebrate his 30th birthday and after a lot of time spent searching through TA and trying to get the best location for the right price I eventually chose Distrikt. I had a lot of communication with them before we went and the staff were really helpful even before we arrived, they were recommending places to go and email replies were always quickly received. To get to the hotel we got a yellow taxi from JFK, it's a flat rate of $52, with the toll it took it to $59, and with tip we paid $65. When we arrived at the hotel it was a quick check in and the staff upgraded the room for us to a King from a Queen which we thought was very sweet. In the lobby there is always fresh water on offer (usually with fruits or cucumber in it), and occasionally hot chocolate, the lobby is also spotless! This hotel is all about service! The hotel room was big enough, the beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. We found issues such as ripped bed sheets which showed stained duvets and pillows, but it wasn't a huge issue for us. There was a delightful coffee/tea machine in the room which was a blessing in the mornings whilst we were adjusting to the time zone, these were restocked every day. The bathroom was small, and there was no bath, but the shower was huge and extremely powerful! There were even complimentary toiletries in there. A nit picky problem with the bathroom was that the toilet flushed extremely loud so if my partner went in the middle of the night it would usually wake me up (I'm a fairly light sleeper though). Obviously paint work and whatnot isn't perfect, there might be some marks around but if you want it spot on then you should pay the premium price. We were on the 15th floor, and there wasn't a view! The noise at night from the room was fairly quiet but police/fire engine sirens could be heard. Be aware that there are currently building works going on around the hotel, they start at 8am and made a fair amount of noise and vibration! (But you're in the city that never sleeps so we were already up at this point) The staff members on reception were incredibly friendly and helpful. They would always welcome you into the hotel and say bye/have a nice day if you were on your way out. One of them brought my boyfriend a cupcake and a hand made card a couple of days after we arrived which was such a kind gesture! In regards of the location, it's between 8th and 9th avenue. It's no more than a 5/10 minute walk to Times Square. There is a bus terminus and access to the subway within a 2 minute walk. We went to see Aladdin on Broadway and that was a 7 minute walk. You cannot get a better hotel or better location for the price they ask. We had some issues which we can only assume was due to the cleaning team, we tipped every day because that's the norm in the USA, but we didn't get anything spectacular. In other hotels where we tip we usually get some kind of towel art or something. However this was not the problem. On our second to last day, we came back to our hotel, luckily it was early at 12pm, and our room had been left open and it wasn't by us. Luckily our room was round a corner, out of view and the last room on that floor. We also had taken all of our valuables and money with us that day because we were going shopping. The reception staff were apologetic and made the staff aware. Nothing of value was missing so we didn't give it a second thought. On our very last day and it came to packing, we noticed we had items missing! The cleaner had thrown away some of our stuff that wasn't even in the bin to be thrown! They weren't expensive, it was a souvenir cup from the basketball at Madison Square, and another souvenir cup from Aladdin, probably the value of $20.These were left on the desk with a load of other things that we had bought. They weren't left anywhere near the bin, every day I made sure that everything that needed throwing, got left in the bin. Again the reception staff apologised but it was too late to do anything about it. That brought a bit of a downer on the hotel, we were only left with 1 souvenir cup which was left on the bed side cabinet. It's fair to say that no tip was left on that last day, we were furious and had it been something more valuable then this review wouldn't have been so nice! When it came to leave, the hotel looked after our luggage till we were ready to leave. When we did leave the gents there were helping us close our very large luggage, they offered to provide us with a private transfer service but we just got a taxi. I still gave the hotel 5/5 because the price was spot on, the location was spot on, the reception staff were brilliant, it's just a shame the cleaning staff let them down in the hotel rooms! I'm sure it doesn't happen in every room though and if I came to NYC again this is the hotel I would stay at! You honestly can't get better for your money!",

      "text": "We stayed with the Distrikt in 2012 and so our experience this time was with comparison to our earlier stay. We booked a comfy no view room. On arrival (17 July) we were greeted warmly and I could not fault the reception. We were initially given room 703 but were really disappointed to find that the room was quite worn/tired, which is reflected in other reviews. The landing looked a little scruffy with a stained carpet, the furniture was scuffed, the a/c churned all night making it difficult to sleep, the shower pressure was really poor and looked like it had limescale, the toilet dripped constantly (another noise to contend with), the sink drained unbelievably slowly and the lamps flickered which was really irritating. In consideration of the price we paid and the fact that this was our yearly holiday, we reported our concerns to a gentleman on reception. He was really helpful and understanding and stated that he would not be able to do anything that evening due to the hotel being sold out. I was advised to attend reception between 9-12 the following morning to look at swapping a room when other guests checked out. I did so and was greeted by a female who (in my opinion) had a really dismissive and abrupt attitude. She advised me that an engineer would be asked to attend the room to check out our concerns. I reiterated what the gentleman had said the previous evening re swapping the room - she said no, an engineer would be asked to review the room and that the staff member the previous night would not have been able to assist further, due to the time the complaint was raised. I disputed this as he never mentioned that an engineer would be attending the following day. I stated that we would be going out for the day and queried what we should do with our luggage (we had not unpacked due to being informed our room would be swapped). I was asked quite curtly \"do you not trust the engineer\" - I responded that, that was not what I was insinuating, and made reference to the disarray of our luggage in the room. I gave the receptionist a written list of issues (as above) as I felt that she was not listening - and looked completely disinterested on receipt. Nonetheless, we went out for the day and in the evening returned to the hotel. There was nothing by way of note left in the room re the engineer and so I attended reception. I was greeted by the gentleman I originally highlighted my concerns to and another female, who were both perfectly pleasant and understanding. I raised my concerns about how my issue had been dealt with in contrast to what I was advised originally, and the attitude of the staff member earlier that day. In my opinion, the two staff members did not appear shocked in the least about the report of the staff member's attitude (has she received more than one?). They said that the engineer had looked at all of my issues and everything was ok with the room. I had already attended the room and the noise was still present, and naturally, they would not be able to address the issue of it looking tired within the day. They offered me a room swap for the following day and I took them up on the offer. They also gave me a $50 gift card for food and drink for the bar on behalf of the manager, which I was grateful for. I inspected room 2103 the following morning and accepted the change. It was exactly the same room but on a higher floor. There was no noise and the shower had more pressure but nonetheless, the room was as tired as the previous room. We were grateful for a swap however on the lack of noise alone. Could not fault the cleanliness and comfort of the room, the bed was really comfy. Following me raising my concerns, I was under the impression that I was treated differently by some of the reception staff. However, the bar staff were really pleasant. Read my review from 2012 and you will see how impressed I was with the Distrikt. I feel that the rooms really do require an uplift or reduce the prices, we paid a lot of money to feel a bit disheartened. I would recommend that some of the staff spend more time with the ones with good customer service, to show how to and how not to deal with concerns raised. In 2012 I felt like I was in a 4-5 star, this time it was definitely deserving of a 3, but it doesn't have to be. And in any event, 3 star doesn't have to mean tired and poor customer service (from some staff members).",

      "text": "I'm a local who had the pleasure of staying at the Distrikt on Friday, May 25, 2012. I originally had another hotel booked through Priceline, but decided to do one more check for a hotel in the same area for a lower price. By a stroke of luck, I saw the Distrikt on Priceline for the same price as the hotel that I originally had booked. Although the price was the same, the rating on TripAdvisor was very different in that Distrikt was rated #4 and the other hotel was rated a bit lower. I decided to go with Distrikt and I am so pleased I did. Although the hotel lobby is small, it is a boutique hotel in Manhattan so you'd never expect to walk into a huge entrance. The lobby is very smartly decorated and every staff member I encountered was so pleasant even if I wasn't dealing with them directly. At the time of my stay they were offering free peach tea and another type of tea (I forgot the type) which was very welcomed especially due to the heat and humidity this particular day/weekend. When I arrived on my floor (6th) I realized that there were probably no more than 7 rooms on my floor, definitely no more than 8, at least from what I could see. I was very pleased upon opening my door to the way the room was designed. The bathroom was wonderful too as there was a stand up shower that was the size of a traditional bathtub. The room and bathroom are very modern, but not in a \"cold\" way as a lot of modernly designed rooms can feel. I was welcomed in my room to a yummy brownie and a welcome letter. The title of my review is very indicative of the hotel. I travel often, to major cities and little towns, and cleanliness is of the UTMOST IMPORTANCE to me!! I inspect hotel rooms almost too closely sometimes so please believe me when I say that this hotel is CLEAN! I saw the vacuum marks on the carpet. This may bother some people, but it delights me to no end. I do not only look at the carpet from afar. I actually get on my hands and knees and inspect parts of the carpet to see how clean it really is (short of using a black light). Yes, this may seem a bit OCD for some people, but nevertheless, it is what it is. The carpet was CLEAN!!! Nothing on the floor -- not even hair!!! The bathroom was also thoroughly inspected and passed the test!!! All of the hardware was clean as well. I usually take the time to Lysol all hardware in the bedroom and bathroom, but this hotel (or at least my room) was so clean that I did not feel the need to. The only thing I Lysol'd was the remote control. I also always usually immediately take the comforter and throw pillows off hotel beds b/c the comforter and throw pillows are usually a couple of the dirtiest things in hotel rooms. I left the comforter exactly where it was and only removed the throw pillows b/c I had no use for them. This hotel room was so clean that I actually walked around barefoot in it the entire time I was there. I note this as important b/c I NEVER WALK AROUND BAREFOOT except for in my own clean house!!!! Check out was 12pm the next day, but they kindly extended me to a 1pm check out. A lot of hotels do this so this was not so special in itself. It is of special mention to me b/c they asked, \"what time would you need to check out?\" I highly doubt they could've extended me past 2pm (2 hours after the regular check out time) not only b/c it is not standard, but also b/c it was the weekend of Fleet Week and a lot of NY hotels in midtown are booked to capacity. So, to actually ASK what time I needed to check out was really nice. If I have to say any negative things about my stay, it would be that I had a crying baby on my floor so I was waken up earlier than I would've liked and the baby cried for a while so it was actually really annoying (although not the Distrikt's fault). The baby sounded like it was actually on the other side of the elevator bank so either the kid was crying really really loudly or the walls were a bit too thin. Also, the elevators were a bit slow for my liking. After checking in around 3pm, I left the room again at about 4:30pm and actually had to wait for about 4 minutes or so for the elevator. Now, this may not seem like a long time, but in all the hotels I've stayed in (and again, I've stayed in MANY hotels --- 2.5 stars to 5 star hotels), I've never actually waited long enough for me to actually realize that I was waiting for the elevator. I would love to stay at the Distrikt again soon!!! The regular room prices, as opposed to any deals found on Priceline, are out of my price range (well over $300/night for the standard Queen room), but I would definitely stay again if I could find another great deal.",

      "title": "BEWARE- BED BUGS!!!!",
      "text": "DO NOT STAY HERE. I have 3 red bed bug bites on my foot, consistent with their \"breakfast, lunch and dinner\" ways. I am allergic to bed bugs and unfortunately have past experience (years ago) with them. That being said, I am not mistaken and I am very well educated on them. I am so mad. Please do not risk staying here bed bugs are a nightmare. Original Yelp Review- Me and my boyfriend arrived to this hotel after a full day of flights which is why we did not leave, this hotel looks like it might of been great when it first opened but it definitely has not been kept up with. Check-in: The ladies at the front desk were not wearing any sort of uniforms or coordinating colors, and looked frumpy and unkept. Not the best presentation for a first impression. Their room key machine also takes forever to register the keys? Lobby: The lobby looks like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. A simple dusting and sweeping would've done wonders. The room: The room was great upon walk in but once settling in we were greeted with unpleasant surprises. I always check my hotel beds because I've had unfortunate situations with bed bugs. I didn't find bed bugs but I did find several hairs in the bedding, which I didn't mention to the front desk because I had a feeling each other room was probably like this. Then I got into the bed and pulled up the comforter to my face to go to sleep. That's when I saw old blood stains. Yuck. At least get a comforter cover that buttons if you want to reuse damaged ones. We then called the front desk to get a fresh one and the one they brought ALSO had a few blood stains! He wasn't even apologetic and acted like we were crazy. There was also a letter waiting here for Mr. Rodriguez, my boyfriends last name is not Rodriguez and does not even start with a R? The TV: It does not have a power button so if you have a remote that works when it wants to like we did you have to stick you hand behind the actual TV next to the caked on dust and attempt to pull out the plug which doesn't really come out all of the way because of how the TV is positioned. Wifi: It's open wifi- scary! People can easily attempt to hack into your server. (My boyfriend is in tech so no it's not tech friendly) The bathroom: Pretty self explanatory, it had a great adjustable vanity mirror! The shower seemed to be stuck with hair so each time you got in you get a foot bath. They gave us a solid towel which we didn't notice until the last night. Pros: The AC really cranks. Quiet neighbors. Proximity to everything. Fluffy pillows. I will not be staying here ever again and we are continuing our say else where.",

      "text": "Err.. Well where do I start?? Okay.. Prior to arriving, I had some issues with the reservation, not with the hotel, but with Booking.com forgetting to put the tax in the quote. However, throughout, Paola at the Distrikt Hotel was very helpful and understanding whilst this matter was dealt with. I then needed to upgrade the room as suddenly my parents decided to come with me! Again, Paola was very understanding and gave me a good deal on an upgrade to a room with 2 doubles. I think this is what it all comes down to: the staff. They are so professional, right from the reservation with Paola, to the porters and the other staff working on the front desk. They are literally able to advise on anything! From advising us on the local restaurants right up to our legal rights as consumers when shopping in NYC, the staff were always on hand to help. The room itself was great - very clean, lovely, modern decor. I really appreciated the handwritten note congratulating me on my graduation, as well as the complimentry chocolate brownie. A copy of the New York Times was delivered each morning, and a good range of amenities was provided. I had some [very] minor issues from the start of my stay. Firstly, I noticed the WiFi signal on my iPhone was very weak, and therefore unable to establish a connection. When I tried on my laptop, it was better, but would keep saying it was unable to connect to the WiFi. The staff at reception provided me with an Ethernet cable, which worked great, but just meant I couldn't use FaceTime on my iPhone in my room, I had to go and use it in reception since the WiFi worked down there. Not a major issue since I wasn't there to use the Internet, I was there to explore NYC! However, this was fixed on around the 3rd or 4th day of me being there, so you know from me that the WiFi on the 16th floor is fully functional! Prior to booking this hotel, I noticed a lot of reviews on TripAdvisor saying how convenient it would be to have a tea/coffee machine in the rooms. Well, I was rather pleased to get a knock on my door one evening asking me if I would like one to be installed in my room! Yes, they have put tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms now, and they're great! Room service refresh the tea/coffee/milk every day and leave a few sachets. If you need any additional, they're just $1. Talking of room service, it was lovely to go back to the room after a long day of shopping/sightseeing to see it was in the usual immaculate condition. The room was cleaned every day without delay. It was great to use the iMacs downstairs in the lobby to print off our boarding passes. There was a little wait due to somebody stealing the wireless keyboard and mouse of one of the iMacs but nothing major. It may be worthwhile to perhaps keep a spare keyboard/mouse (even if it's a cheap USB wired one) rather than having 1 iMac out of use for a few days or more. We ate breakfast at the hotel once, and it was great. Sure, the caf\u00e9 down the road might be more value for money, but I would recommend eating at the Distrikt at least once purely for the experience. As usual, the service/staff etc was superb, and so was the food itself. Overall, I wouldn't stay anywhere else when travelling to NYC. This was our first trip to anywhere in the US and we just felt so welcome at the Distrikt. We look forward to seeing you again in the future!",

      "text": "The hotel location is phenomenal, about 2 blocks from Times Square. And the drink tickets were nice, though not worth the $25 \"resort fee\" they charge you. But my main issue was just a few minutes after my partner I i finished making love, while still partially naked, a lovely foreign walks right into our room. They were confused, we were confused. I called the front desk. No one came. No one assisted. A front desk person should have immediately been up the elevator. Instead, I was asked, \"well what are you doing in that room. We have you booked in a a different room?\" No apology, no manager coming up to fix it. just me and my partner frantically trying to cover ourselves up. A poor foreign couple getting the New York experience of a lifetime and ZERO response from the hotel. The gentleman at the front desk said he would have the manager come find as as quickly as he could. He confirmed that the room was indeed ours and they would rebook the other guests. We showered, got dressed, and after an hour of no one coming up, left to go explore the city. When we came back, we could not get into our room. We went downstairs and were told that that room was no longer ours and was issued to another guest!!! The male front desk attendant was a complete moron and still hadn't made the updates in the system. Another attendant re-issued our key cards (STILL NOTHING FROM A MANAGER) and we went back to our room. Several minutes later a manager did stop by with an apology and a bottle of wine. I explained that a bottle of wine was not enough to make up for having us barged in on. She explained that was all she could offer and would speak to the general manager the next day to see if more could be done. We booked directly through Hilton, so she said they couldn't offer anything more, but that the GM would reach out before we checked out or call me. Upon checkout we asked for our bags (which we had checked earlier in the day to go exploring) The same moron male front desk attendant said he would text someone to get our bags. We waited nearly 40 minute and nothing. After several other guests had come to get their bags and got them we asked what the delay was, The moron completely forgot about us. He said, Please give me your ticket.\" I explained that we already gave it to him. The competent female attendant took the ticket, asked why he waited so long if there was no response to the text he sent and went to retrieve our bags. She came bag and stated that she couldn't find them. She then asked moron if they were behind the counter with him. Sure enough. Our bags had been sitting right there behind this idiot the entire time. FIRE or retrain mop top, idiot male front desk attendant. We've been home now for 3 days and still no contact from the manager about compensation for being walked in on.",

      "text": "This hotel is pretty cool. Overall, it is upscale and well-designed, but there are a few details about the hotel that I found a little strange or uncomfortable. I was thinking of giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of these minor little details but decided that it has nothing to do with the staff or room and I did not want to diminish the overall quality of this place. The only minor issues I found imperfect was the fact that the front entrance was not on Broadway but actually on 47th street which kind of threw me off because I thought an iconic hotel like this would be right on Broadway with a grand and obvious entrance. Also strange and uncomfortable was the fact that we had to take an elevator up to the lobby and walk over to another part of the hotel to check-in. Then, we waited on line for about 10 minutes. The staff were great from the beginning and were not only professional and accommodating but overall, friendly also. Then, we walked over to another part of the building to take the elevators up to our room. These first 15 minutes or so were the only downside, if you want to call it that. It was not a big enough deal for us to take points away from them as it was part of the design and culture of the hotel. (Walking through the different parts of the hotel reveals areas where we can lounge, grab a drink, socialize, etc. In the evening, there are people all over these public areas of the hotel (lobby) hanging out. To begin with, the room was beautiful! We stayed in a junior suite with separate living room and bedroom so it was especially spacious, but even without the living area, the bedroom was quite large (for NYC). All the furnishings and decorations were very modern and stylish as well as comfortable. I settled right in and wished that this was my apartment. By the way, knowing that this was an anniversary celebration for us, the hotel manager left a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in the room for us! The bed was very comfortable and the we really loved all the big windows that revealed the New York skyline up close in the heart of Times Square. The bathrooms were also well appointed and designed, and no need to mention how immaculately clean everything was...wife is a neat freak so this was crucial. The room was just perfect for us! The staff were always attentive and helpful as well as professional and friendly. If I asked a question, they did not just answer, they would show me by either taking me there or giving me exact directions and offering to assist further if needed! That is professional! As far as the area is concerned, this hotel is in the heart of Times Square. We walked right out of the building and a few steps to the corner to get onto Broadway and everything is right there. Stay away from the crazy Elmos and Doras and any other characters that take a picture with you and then demand money for posing with you. They are aggressive and can get rude and even obnoxious. Otherwise, what a beautiful area to walk around in at night. Everything is open late, there are crowds of people everywhere, and the vibe is just awesome! We shopped in the area a bit, but be careful that such tourist traps don't rip you off! There are much better deals on clothing and such in other areas of the city FYI, but window shopping in some of the huge retail stores in the area is fun. We saw the Broadway play Lion King which was just a few blocks over and truly enjoyed it. We ate at Carmine's beforehand which we loved and got some ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery after the show...amazing how many people are on line to get ice cream at 11:30 at night in NYC! We walked everywhere and the location of the hotel was so convenient. Also, the subway is just a block (or two) away and there are buses right there too. Your options are unlimited! We hung out until 2:30 am after having a few drinks at the Blue Fin which is part of the W hotel I think. and it was still bustling with people everywhere. Gotta love NYC! The W hotel is not cheap, but if you want to give your wife an awesome experience in NYC like I did, this is the place to go. My wife will never forget the experience we had there and much of it is thanks to the W hotel's staff, location, amenities, and overall quality of the product and service that is the W. Thank you W hotel! We will see you again soon. Love you guys!",

      "text": "Arriving late at night during one of the big New York snowstorms after flying in from Vegas we were tired and just wanted to get to our room. Pulling up at the hotel downstairs, we were greeted nicely by the bellboys and they helped us with all our luggage, which is standard/expected of a \"5 star\" hotel. We were shown the lift and advised where to proceed to check-in etc. All good so far. There was one guy working at the check-in counter, very casually dressed and very \"laid back\". He finished serving the guest in front of us and welcomed us to the hotel. Then simply asked for my ID and credit card, then within about 30 seconds I had my room key and was told my room number and that was it. No mention of my Gold status, which while nothing special, every other SPG branded hotel at least mention it and say \"thank you for staying with us again\" No mention of a room upgrade or anything extra either, granted we were staying in the Fantastic Suite, so there are no upgrades possible, but at least spend a bit of time explaining the hotel! Also given we were spending 5 nights here I would have expected a little bit more effort. That being said, we were tired and just wanting to get to the room and warm up, so I didn't ask anything and we went up to the room. Baggage, was up within a few mins with no problems there. The room we assigned, at first glance was lovely. Then once we started looking around we realized we had been allocated a disabled/accessible room (more on that later). Added to that we were only on the 30th (roughly) floor and not anywhere near the top of the hotel. The view was blocked by a \"lovely\" concrete ledge, so we could JUST see times square if we were standing in the corner of the bedroom. It was probably one of the worst Fantastic Suites available, as no other room type like this had the ledge blocking the view towards Times Square. So back downstairs I went, and asked about a room change, of course the standard \"Sorry, there are no other rooms available tonight, you can check back tomorrow and see if anything comes up, as someone SHOULD be checking out\" Of course, before going down I had checked availability and there were at least 9 Fantastic Suites available as they were bookable. According to the bell boys the hotel wasn't even 50% full, as I did ask that when arriving out of interest. After pushing him with my information, he said all he can do it put a note in the system for a \"room change\", come back tomorrow after 3pm and we would have another room. He denied knowing that he was assigning me an accessible room with no view, so of course, he didn't say sorry. I then watched him check-in an older couple and he was just as fast and rude to them as well and they were left standing around wondering where to go next after getting their room key.... So I left it at that and headed out to get something quick for dinner. More on the room - The accessible room, had two bathrooms which was nice, the standard small bathroom, and then the accessible bathroom, which had an ugly seat in the shower, no shower curtain/door, no bench space near the sink. In the end we should have stayed in this room, as the 2nd room was in fact worse... Yes the beds were nice and the rooms were designed in a modern feel. Yes they were dark, and probably not good if you are over 45 years old, that did not concern us at all. What really lets this hotel down is the cheap renovation they did and it sure does show. Basically all the old cracking/peeling/damaged walls simply were painted over, and painted poorly. So you can see all the old paint/wallpaper/peeling and all the damage underneath it. There is probably a reason why they like the rooms being so dark. Lots of small maintenance issues as well, like the shower taps falling off, lights not working, weird noises from the air conditioning and just a lack of maintenance. The air conditioning panel in the living room of the suite, was falling off as was the air con panel in the bedroom. As a result the panels would rattle and make lots of weird noises throughout the night. Also the huge gap around them meant a large dark hole leading up into the air conditioning black hole. We did expect to see a rat in there at some stage, but we missed out on that. Basically the hotel has had a cheap and poor renovation combined with no maintenance really doesn't help. This hotel only around 12 months ago, and already it's falling apart. How they expect to get another 6-7 years out of this hotel I really don't know. They can't make the rooms any darker... Okay, so the next day after 3pm, I went down and asked about the room change, given that our room had not been serviced it must have been noted in the system. The girl who helped me was lovely this time, she said yes there is a request but it wouldn't let her allocate a new room. She went and spoke to the Manager, and we were given a new room only a few stories from the top floor, which was what I expected when we checked it. The girl said she would send up a bellboy to help with luggage and move us to the new room in about 10 mins and I went back to our old room. After a few mins the bellboy arrived, and I informed him we weren't ready yet, he was not happy about this and grumbled about having to wait around. I offered to call down when I was ready and he gumbled about already being upstairs and waiting.. So I said I'll be about 5-10 mins and he grumbled again. I then offered to take the new room key off him and move the luggage myself. He said that was not possible, so then I simply said I'll be 5-10 mins and shut the door on him. I am not interested in New York attitude when I am staying in the 2nd highest room category and I am changing rooms because of the incompetence of the hotel/staff. After a few mins I went to the door and he was around the corner on her phone sending messages or something, and simply said \"You ready yet?\" I said yes and he got our luggage and said he'd meet us on the new floor. We got to the new room and walked in and the view was perfect, he put all the luggage where we requested and was a bit friendlier at this stage. We tipped him well, and that was that. Okay, this room... Had the one normal bathroom and another 1/2 bathroom (toilet and basin) and a much better un-obstructed view over Times Square. Again the room had maintenance issues which we never bothered to report as no doubt the whole hotel has bits and pieces broken/not working. Firstly the nice little blue mood light in the shower just below knee level was not there, it was covered over with an old tile. The light switch in the bathroom was still there for it, but of course it didn't do anything. No biggie but you don't have those poorly repaired items in a \"5 star hotel\". The more annoying bit was that the air conditioning unit in the bedroom didn't work in this room. As mentioned above, the suites have an air con unit in the living room and also one in the bedroom. This was annoying as not much air makes it way to the bedroom and we like to have the bedroom cooler and the living room warmer. Again, we didn't report this as there was no point. In the 1/2 bathroom, the tap was broken, meaning it was hard to wash your hands, again we just let it go. This hotel was in the middle of a long USA trip involving lots of SPG hotels. After staying here I was very tempted to cancel the other 16 nights in SPG managed hotels, but I decided to let the other hotels have their chance and ignore the W brand. However, I won't be staying at the W New York - Times Square ever again. For those that don't read all the above a Summary - Poorly and cheaply renovated and maintained hotel. Mostly rude staff. Rooms have various bits and pieces falling off and not repaired correctly. Location is great, and the gym was nice. Rooms are dark, so if you over 45 you may not like it. On the surface the rooms appear great, but it is simply a cheap, fast and nasty renovation that was done. Considering this hotel will be operating for another 5-8 years before the next renovation cycle, I hate to see how the rooms are in a few years.",

During my latest stay there, it was all that but more importantly it was home to me for three weeks while on a business trip in midtown Manhattan. While \"home\" may not be the first thing that comes to mind, when one first sets foot in the hotel, the service, enthusiasm, and friendliness of the staff exemplifies the high standard of service and professionalism that I expect, but not always receive, from the hospitality industry. My requests for a coffee maker and a mini refrigerator upon check- in were immediately addressed, and concerns about a malfunctioning lock brought concerned inquiries from Mr. Patrick Armano, Guest Relations Manager, who sent the maintenance manager to personally address my concerns. The housekeeping staff was quick to respond to my requests to clean my room at specific times depending on my schedule. In this regard, I would like to commend Connie, the housekeeping staff member assigned to maintaining my room (4311). Connie always greeted me with a smile and never failed to ask about my stay and to offer her assistance should I need anything else. She did so with never failing cheerfulness and sincerity which make frequent travelers like me feel that our business is really appreciated. I would also like to express my appreciation to the bell staff who were quick to respond to requests for assistance with friendly courtesy. Likewise, the door staff on the ground floor whose outgoing personalities exemplify the fun image of the hotel. The front desk staff has mastered the art of maintaining a good balance of friendliness and professionalism, which, in my opinion is a key element of good hospitality and service. A billing mistake regarding a late checkout fee was promptly resolved. The staff truly personified the W's signature \"whatever/whenever\" service. The W Hotel Times Square will always be my hotel of choice when I come to Manhattan.",

Needless to say, I had spectacular expectations\u2026 Check-in was OK and we managed to get the room early, a little before 12. The room was a bit, well, normal and \u2013 short of the view \u2013 there wasn\u2019t much to write home about. The general upkeep of the room was a bit shabby in places (scratched headboard/furniture) and felt a bit \u2018past it\u2019. Not really the uber-cool, \u2018it\u2019 hotel anymore. The bathroom was clean and came with decent (Bliss) toiletries. The towels were a bit small and it was disappointing to find that there were no robes included, especially at this price point. Clearly a \u2018spectacular\u2019 room doesn\u2019t come with spectacular extras. Got back to the room late at night and went straight to bed. Woke a few times due to noise from street and tossed/turned for a while I tried to get back to sleep. Woke up, early, with a sore back and a bit cranky from a bad night\u2019s sleep. I\u2019m a bit quiet in the morning (until I\u2019ve had a coffee) so we ordered breakfast which turned out to be the W interpretation of a \u2018Continental\u2019; coffee/juice (both with cling film left on) and a choice of muffins (which we went for) or croissants. And that was breakfast. Totally underwhelmed. When we finally got chatting (post-coffee), partner chirped up that he also had sore back and had slept poorly. Uh oh\u2026we decided to investigate the bed/mattress. On pulling off the bottom sheet it was immediately evident why we\u2019d had a rubbish night on it; a sorry, sagging and lumpy mattress. And when I say sagging, I mean it. A deformed and \u2013 well \u2013 \u2018dead\u2019 mattress. A few minutes later we went down to check out. The guy asked how everything was. I told him about the mattress. His response to this was to offer us 5,000 SPG points (I\u2019m not an SPG member so no use to me) and to clear the \u2018extras\u2019, ie. coffee and juice that shouldn\u2019t have been charged anyway. Unsatisfied with this derisory offer, I asked to speak with a supervisor and Briana came out. Briana made all the right noises but seemed unwilling to do much more than say how sorry she was. And sorry and sorry and sorry. But I didn\u2019t want \u2018sorry\u2019, I wanted compensation for a night spent in an unspectacular room sleeping on a spectacularly uncomfortable mattress. This went on for a while with Briana repeating that she couldn\u2019t recompense me as I\u2019d booked through a third-party, Hotel.com (despite the fact that the revenue goes to W anyway!). I told Briana that I\u2019d like a free night (the next evening) in light of the fact that the key element of my stay (ie. a good sleep) hadn\u2019t been provided. Briana would only offer a 50% discount (because rooms were selling at $500+ and it was sooo busy) wasn\u2019t going to budge. I demanded that somebody accompany me to the room to see said (sad) mattress. Alex, a \u2018Style manager\u2019 was to meet me in the room a few minutes later. Alex duly turned up (hands-in-pockets concentrating on looking very cool but avoiding eye contact) and duly confirmed that the mattress was in fact a dud one. He then went on to inform me that \u201cbecause the hotel is sooo busy, it\u2019s easy to miss these sort of things\u201d. A hotel with no process for spotting a saggy, dead mattresses? Yep, from the (smirking) horse\u2019s mouth. Back at reception, Briana (after getting the news from uber-cool Alex) then agrees to comp me a room for the next night, two double beds though as that was all that was left. She now knew that I was right and she had been wrong. In conclusion, this was a pretty poor experience and made for an unspectacular birthday-night stay. The hotel could have redeemed itself a little by making the second stay spectacular-ish; maybe a fruit-plate, a bottle of wine or even breakfast. But no, they didn\u2019t think I was worth it. Given the choice, I\u2019d definitely stay at the Residence Inn (1717 Broadway) where we also stayed on this trip. Great service, great views, shiny and new and a spectacularly comfortable bed. NB. For the record, I got a \u2018could we have made your stay better?\u2019 email from Alice Allaire which I responded to. After seven days (and no \u2018out of office\u2019) she hadn\u2019t written back. Sort of says it all.",

      "text": "My husband and I stayed here for a weekend with plans to see a show and visit some of the attractions in Times Square. Check in was quick and efficient, and we received a room on the 41st floor with a nice view of the river. The room was a reasonable size and very comfortable. The bathroom was quite small with no storage space for personal toiletries which I always find a drawback when I travel. Everything has a neon \"mod\" feel and takes a little getting used to if you aren't used to the W brand. Wifi costs about 14.99 a day (unless you get a starwood member upgrade to free) and the business center computer costs $13.00 to use. I have never understood this policy with Starwood. They are one of the few hotels that charge for Wifi, and their Wifi has ALWAYS been a problem, wherever I stay in the Starwood community. It fades in and out and simply doesn't work well. That said, I would like to compliment one of the many helpful employees at W who went out of her way to help me with a Wifi issue at the hotel. I had to print tickets to the 911 Memorial in order to visit it during our stay. Pamela McKenna at the front desk, had me email my PDF tickets to her in order to print them out. The Wifi wasn't working properly, and the tickets weren't coming through. It took close to an hour, but she stayed with the problem until we had out tickets in hand. We really appreciated her efforts. We had dinner and breakfast at the Blue Fin restaurant and LOVED the food and service there! I recommend the top floor of the restaurant for the nicest ambience, but you will find the attentiveness and quality of the food magnificent, wherever you are seated! Although the hotel is showing signs of wear, here and there, like in the bar couches and cushions, I would definitely stay there again.l",

      "text": "We have been coming to NYC every summer for 10+ years. A few years ago we stayed at W Lexington and met a great manager there who moved to W Times Square so for 3 years have been staying at W Times Square. Well she left the hotel and unfortunately our experience was MUCH different this time and not in a good way. The only reason this is 2 stars and not 1 star is because of Jermaine at Concierge and Adam the bellman - both of them were a ray of sunshine in an otherwise disappointing visit. This is the rest of the story. We requested early check-in. We were up at 4am and kiddo naps. We mentioned this on reservations. While I know not guaranteed it has always been honored in the past based on our loyalty/history and the fact that we have a small child. When we checked in at noon we were told our room wasn't ready - that he could put us in other adjoining rooms but advised we wait because best rooms in house. Of course we wanted those rooms based on fanfare but after trying to kill 2.5 hours with a cranky 4 year old called hotel to see if they had just forgotten to call. I mean check in guy said our rooms would be cleaned first given circumstances. Also at check in Our baggage was left in middle of lobby by bellman so before leaving asked for claim check and for it to be moved. After several minutes my mom asked concierge and then someone finally came but got swarmed by others that weren't there first so my poor mom whose BIRTHDAY is today and the reason we are here in first place had to speak up which she hates doing. Well I called rang and rang came back to Michael at operator he said all busy. So I go back to hotel wait in line for a second time - 6 people in line at 230. No SPG line. After waiting get to the most rude, condescending, and unfriendly front desk agent and human being I have ever met. I didn't get her name because was so upset and had to cause a scene at check-in which is not something I enjoy doing. When I got to her I said I apologize in advance if I am short with you. I have been traveling since 4am with a 4 year old and she has started to fuss because exhausted. I explained that I was walking over because no one answered the phone. She smugly responded well did anyone call you with a nasty tone. I said no she said well its not ready in same nasty tone. I said if check out is 12 and you know we are arriving at 12 and its now 230 how do you not have at least one of two rooms done. It doesn't take that long to clean the rooms (I know because husband works for a luxury resort as well). She proceeds to explain to me the prior guests are gold members so have til 4 to check out. That's wrong on so many levels. Most hotels ONLY allow late check out if no one is coming in after regardless of rank. We are the #1 vip at Villas at Grand Cypress in Orlando and go 6 times a year and we get denied for checkout on the presidential villas at time too. Also if our check in time is 4 regardless how can someone checkout at 4 and delay us? We had plans we needed to leave by at 4 so asked for a \"loaner room\" like The Ritz Carlton has just so our daughter could freaking take a nap! Otherwise we wouldn't be back until 10pm and would still have to settle into our room, unpack her meds and bedtime routine she wouldn't sleep til midnight at that rate! She said we don't offer that and you seem very upset should I call a manager? Umm what? I didn't ask for a manager so apparently she didn't want to deal with me. Meanwhile my child is causing a scene melting down because as I have already informed her several times we are tired! Manager who is equally rude comes out says basically the usual front desk lies sold out busy blah blah blah. Typical front desk excuse per my husband. She says can switch rooms but no longer cool corner room Times Square but \"equally nice room\"). I call BS! If it were as nice why weren't we offered that instead of this amazing upgraded room we paid for and were sold on. But with my tired baby I said fine whatever we will deal even though disappointed. She proceeds to inform me only 1 of 2 rooms is ready. Again at this point I am so over the stares of other guests and these front desk agents who should never be interacting with people I just give up. I am embarrassed for having to fight for my child's needs and having to raise my voice. I felt like I was on a hidden camera show it was so unbelievable. Last check-in they handed out champagne. This time was a slap in the face. At least be sympathetic. This is HOSPITALITY as in be hospitable LOL. And when I thought it couldn't get worse...go to tuck kid in makeup stains all over duvet cover. My kid drops a toy under bed while maid arrives to change the covers and finds a pistachio still in its shell (not ours) which is a choking hazard under the bed. I tell maid the next room is ours too she says just finished cleaning. I said ok will send mom down for key 2. Mom goes down - waits in line third time for several minutes AGAIN - they say no notification its clean. Same terrible front desk agent as before and she again gets a tone \"well you are still in WELL before check-in! Ugg at least have sympathy! So all 4 of us 6 bags jogging stroller in one tiny NYC room. Needless to say she did NOT nap and it ruined all of our days. Not a good start for my moms birthday. My husband went down a FOURTH time to get key but saw manager in hallway and got it finally. Got in this room the long pink throw pillow had a smear of thick brownish substance on it so I put it under bed so didn't have to deal with it. But eww! Also, this room was by the ice machine and the housekeeping storage closet so we were hearing ice pinging into a metal bucket and doors slamming in and out of storage closets all night and early morning which disrupted out sleep so I highly double the rooms we got were \"equally\" nice. And we PAID for the nicer rooms and no adjustment was made for having these rooms. I definitely wonder what rooms we would have had that were so nicely blocked for us and meant for us to have a remarkable birthday weekend. I am very disappointed that our time of feeling loyal to this hotel has run out. A hiccup here are there fine but every single staff member who overheard this conversation just looked at me like I was the crazy one. None must be parents. I know many want into rooms earlier but we NEEDED it for our daughters health and well being. She has asthma and has been hospitalized 4 times in her life so rest is important so its the mama bear that comes out. Also sometimes its not what you say its how you say it. These people shouldn't work in hospitality!",

      "text": "We are always told ... location, location, location. Well, not only does the Ameritania Hotel have the best location, but the staff is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! So with a central location in midtown Manhattan matched with the best staff, smiles and service, this is a true \"home\" to stay in. The newly renovated and tastefully decorated rooms are superb. The beds are so comfortable, it's tough to get up. The rooms have a huge mirror ... so chic and also so useful. The spa-like showers were the best. Just a true pleasure to stay here. The exterior does not do justice to this little gem of a hotel in Manhattan. Beautiful historic facade, but truly modern and hip inside. The staff: Sylvia, Annya, Enrico, Angie, Jose, Crystal .... and everyone else ... all the best. Service from the heart. Always busy with guests, but everyone is dealt with with warmth and true attention. I called in the night before to check for an early arrival possibility and Enrico told me the hotel was not sold out. He blocked a room that evening, to ensure I would have a room early the following morning, and Sylvia checked me in as early as 9am the following morning. I felt confident to come to the city early, knowing I would have a place to stay and not just hang out in the lobby. This is truly a hidden gem in Manhattan. Close enough to the excitement of Times Square, but not directly where all the noise is at. And also close enough to the business district of midtown. Central Park is around the corner, as well as the best shopping, restaurants and entertainment of New York. Keep up the good work. I look forward to coming back, and will gladly tell everyone about you.",

      "title": "Great Location, Style, Value",
      "text": "I spent 4 nights (Mon-Fri) in June at the Ameritania, with my husband and 14 year-old son. I booked directly with the hotel (on their website), during their 40%-off promotion, which was a great deal. Location: The Ameritania is strategically located in the heart of NYC, in walking-distance of the most popular tourist attractions (like Central Park, Broadway theaters, Times Square, the Rock, 5th Ave shopping, etc.). Two subway stations within a block or two will swiftly take you to the more remote tourist attractions (like the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Wallstreet, etc.). Times Square (which gets very loud and crowded at night) is less than a 10-minute walk from the hotel, meaning it's close enough to walk to the sights, but far enough from the noise. Noise: It's not fair to hotels to stay in a loud/busy area and then give them a bad review for noise, so consider a hotel's proximity to Times Square if noise is a concern for you. (Hint: background noise or sleep sound machines/phone apps help you sleep, by filling the room with calming, consistent sounds which drown out noise outside of your room.) NYC traffic is generally loud and busy. A room with a nice city view will make sure you hear the car horns and sirens at all hours. Keeping the window closed at night helps, but rooms without views tend to be quieter. Our room was right in front of the elevators, which meant we occasionally heard people outside of our door, but fortunately most people know to keep quiet in the hallways. Rooms: Our room was lovely, stylish, clean, and quite spacious for NYC hotels. The room included two queen beds, a well-stocked mini bar, a desk and chair, an arm chair, and a very large full-length mirror. In the closet I found an umbrella, which, if I understood correctly, is available for your use at not charge, unless it comes up missing. That seemed really neat, but we didn't need an umbrella during our stay. The bathroom had a large walk-in shower with both a rainfall showerhead and a removable showerhead. Bathroom amenities included shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, a bar soap, and a hair dryer. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a very nice street view, which was not necessary for us, as we spent very little time in the room. The hotel has three elevators, all of which were in service during our stay, but stairs are available for people who enjoy a challenge. Runners/Athletes: I chose this hotel because it's located between Central Park and the major tourist attractions, and the price was a great value. I was able to get up at 0630h and walk four blocks to Central Park for my morning run. The park is full of runners, cyclists, and dog walkers between 0600h - 0800h, so you'll be in great company. Central Park is safe, very well maintained, and there are plenty of clean bathroom facilities throughout. I love this park. I read that the hotel has a gym, but I did not see it or use it, as my needs were met by the park. Food: The Ameritania is two blocks away from (a neighborhood called) Hell's Kitchen, where you can enjoy a wide variety of excellent international cuisine at varied prices. Just on 9th Avenue we ate Chinese, Afghani, Indian, and American food during our stay, and all of it was delightful. Cafes, delis, hot dog stands, and pizzerias are all close by. You won't go hungry here. The hotel offers breakfast downstairs, at an additional cost, but we grabbed pastries and coffee on the go, from nearby cafes. Airport Transportation: We flew into LaGuardia airport, bought the weeklong metro tickets for each of us at the Terminal 2 gift shop on our way out to the bus, took the Q70 bus to the 74th Street/Roosevelt Ave station, and from there took the E train all the way to the 7th Ave subway stop. From the subway we just had to walk one block to the hotel. There are other busses and other trains that will take you just as close. Taxis would have been an option for us as well, but we arrived during afternoon rush-hour, and I felt like the train was a better option for us. The weeklong metro tickets are good for all public busses and trains, ended up being a great value for us during our stay. NYC's mass transit is excellent, and you'll get the most out of your visit, if you take the time to familiarize yourself with navigating train maps and subway stations in advance. (Hint: Unless you're keeping your weeklong metro ticket for scrapbooking, consider passing the ticket to an arriving passenger at the airport metro ticket machine, if there are still a few days left to use the pass.) Concierge/Staff: Everyone at the hotel was polite and helpful. The few needs we had were met. The water dispenser in the lobby was at all times full of cold water and greatly appreciated by us. Summary: The Ameritania is lovely, well-situated, (at the discounted rate from their website) a great value, and I would gladly stay here again.",

      "title": "**Detailed Review** Nice hotel, perfect location, great surroundings!",
      "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights over St.Patricks Day and were very happy with our stay. I had emailed ahead of our visit requesting a high room with a view and when we checked in they were able to give us what I had asked for. We had a room on the 8th floor with two windows, one facing Broadway and the other facing 54th Street. We had booked a superior room with Hotels.com, we were going to book a standard room however there was a great offer on superior rooms! (Plus I was worried about the size of the standard rooms as I heard rooms in NY are very small). The room was an ok size, about the size of a standard room back home (Ireland) so it was fine for us two, glad we didn't book a standard! Room d\u00e9cor was up to date, nothing spectacular but still modern and a great big mirror in the corner. Plus a massive TV with plenty of channels. The bathroom was extremely small, only room for one at a time, but it\u2019s fine for all the time you need it. The shower was like a wet room, very powerful shower however with no curtain the water came out over the side a good bit, still a great shower though! The bed (in exact words of my boyfriend) the best bed he had ever slept on! It was so comfortable! As we were facing the road we got a good bit of traffic noise during the night, some nights weren\u2019t as bad as others but after a night or two you get used to it. Plus the hotel provides earplugs. They also provided shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and there\u2019s a hairdryer. There\u2019s a small wardrobe with a safe, an ironing board and an iron. Each evening when we arrived back at the hotel, our bed had been made and new towels in the bathroom. I think our sheets were changed a few times too. If you\u2019re using the glasses provided, then make sure you pour anything out of it when you\u2019re done or they won\u2019t replace with clean ones. The room was very clean so no faults there. There was a minibar in our room and like any other hotel everything in it was quite expensive, but the doorman showed us where the supermarket was just down the street. I had emailed ahead of our visit requesting a room with a mini fridge, which I thought was just going to be the mini bar, so that I could put some things in it myself, however when we arrived at the room, there was a minibar AND a mini fridge provided! So I could put plenty of my own things into it! It was a great help! The doormen were very helpful our whole stay, opening the door for us each time we went out and came in, they also took our bags from the taxi and to the taxi when we arrived and left. We asked them plenty of questions about the attractions and places to eat, they were a great help, especially Saeed. The reception staffs were friendly and helpful also. We didn\u2019t use the hotel bar, it\u2019s quite small and we never seen a barman there our whole stay. We also never ate breakfast there as it was $14 for a continental breakfast which we thought was dear. However the breakfast room was packed every morning. The location of this hotel is second to none, 5minute walk to Times Square and only a few blocks from central park, 5th Avenue, The Museum of Modern Art and plenty of bars and shops. We did get the subway to all the major attractions, Statue of Liberty, Empire State, Rockefeller Centre and Soho. We didn\u2019t buy the $30 pass, which I think lasts for 7 days as we didn\u2019t think we would need it, we probably should have bought it to begin with because I\u2019d say we spent $30/$40 on the subway between us. You can buy these at any of the subway stations when you go to buy a ticket it will give you this option. I have to point out that one of the cons of this hotel is there no free Wifi. I think you pay $10 for 1 night or $20 for 3 nights. We didn\u2019t use it as a lot of restaurants, attractions and cafes do have free Wifi however it would be extremely helpful to have free Wifi in the hotel to contact home easily. The bar next door, The Three Monkeys and Starbucks across the road both have free Wifi. We had a few drinks in The Three Monkeys however there was never a big crowd in it. There\u2019s a dollar pizza place just across the road from the hotel entrance, (out the door and straight up broadway, it\u2019s on the left). Just be careful not to add to many toppings (like we did) as the price soon goes up! We ate breakfast in a diner called Lindy\u2019s which is between 7th and 8th Ave on 53nd Street (I think it\u2019s ment to be famous for cheesecake). It looks lovely from the outside but I would recommend that you don\u2019t eat there! So expensive for all it is, we ordered an omelette at $18 and a bagel & bacon at $14! Glass of orange was $7! It was a very expensive breakfast! Then we found Apple Jacks, if you go outside the hotel and go straight up Broadway, past the $1 pizza place, it\u2019s there on the left. It\u2019s a typical American diner, not very pretty from the outside but great breakfasts and very reasonably priced. Go there for breakfast and it\u2019ll keep you going all day! For dinner we ate one night in an Italian restaurant, near the Wicked show, can\u2019t mind its name, but a man at reception recommended it. Don\u2019t eat there, overpriced and not great portions. We were surprised at how expensive food was to buy, eating out in the evening for 2 people including one drink each plus tip was costing us $100. So some evenings we just took pizza back to the room! If you plan to eat out every evening in half decent restaurants, bring plenty of cash! We wanted to hit a few Irish bars, we were recommended The Mean Fiddler, which is between 7th & 8th Ave on 47th Street. It had plenty of clubbing music the night we went (Night before St.Paddys Day) however no live music. If you\u2019re going out on the rip, this would be the place to go! Another good one with good live music and always plenty of people in is on 7th Ave between 53rd & 54th street. Can\u2019t mind its name but it\u2019s across the road from another Irish pub called \u2018The Irish Pub\u2019! I\u2019ve heard it is good too. There\u2019s no shortage of Irish bars around the Ameritania Hotel! If you\u2019re doing attractions, you should buy some of the tickets online before you go like we did. It costs no more and it means you don\u2019t have to wait in some lines. Statue of Liberty, Top of the Rock, Empire State Building are a few we bought beforehand. All great attractions and I\u2019d recommend all 3! We also did the Natural History Museum, which we thought we\u2019d spend 2/3 hours tops, we ended up spending near 5 hours in it! It\u2019s so big and great for couples & families! Go early in the morning (also for the other attractions) as there\u2019s less of a line! Central park is a lovely walk in the good weather. Lots of street entertainers and great landmarks from popular movies! Apologies that I went on a rant there, but if you\u2019re anything like me you\u2019ll want to know all the info about inside and outside the hotel! All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone, travelling alone or in pairs! We will definitely be back!",

We bought ours in NY, ask about bus stops, where they are and how you can spot them and bus times, when you buy your ticket. We went to NY from 30th July to 5th August 2014, it was very hot & humid, the humidity is so high, so take trainers & socks! Drink plenty of water too! NY is very safe to walk around at night too, there is a family atmosphere from around 5pm, lots of families out and about, the Disney store is open till 1am, we never felt threatened at all, most foods are covered in cheese! so be prepared! Don't forget to tip the door staff $1 every time you enter & leave the building, we didn't realise till we were leaving, also leave a tip for your maid too, read the leaflets in your hotel bedroom and they guide you on certain aspects such as tips! Do make the trip to The Top of the Rock, the views are spectacular, queues are likely but worth the wait, go near sunset if you can, then you get light & dark.

Majid was customer service personified. He did everything allowable to support a family with two small children. We have been coming to New York City for 15 years. This month, I decided to quit my job and could no longer stay at our normal hotels. If not for the beds, this would have been a low cost option. Perfect location to Central Park, Times Square, and 5th Avenue Shopping. Pros: - Location, Location, Location - around the corner from the Brooklyn Diner, Pazza Notte, the Russian Tea Room, and so close to nearly everything. - Clean-ish - the beds, the sinks, and the tubs were clean. I may be a bit nitpicky looking at light switches and such, but ...hey, I have to be honest - the rooms were clean enough - sheets and bathrooms were all that really matter. - Customer Service - We only dealt with Majid, but he was excellent. - Price - Awesome CON: - Comfort - Oh my goodness - absolutely not. No. It was not comfortable. First, if those were double beds, then I am 20 again. My husband and I both were 6 feet tall, we decided the second night not to sleep together, but to each take a small child, so we could lay diagonally so our feet would not hang off. More importantly, the mattresses were not soft, they were mushy. It was like sitting on a mostly filled water bed - we took turns sitting in the chair to put on our shoes, because each time that any one would sit on the edge of the bed to slip on a shoe, the bed would move and give like a mushy water bed. In sum, mushy waterbed from the 80s feeling of trying to sit or sleep. I really, really want to like the place. The price is perfect, the location is perfect, and it is cleanish. However, only the children thought the beds were fun.",

      "text": "It is hard to comment on a hotel in NY. Anybody who has been there or is in the process of looking for accommodation in Manhattan knows how overpriced and pretentious it can get. I think this hotel rates very high in the Tripadvisor community and the score is consistent on almost 3,000 reviews at the time I'm writing. So I guess the way to look at this is the following: in a place like Manhattan Ameritania is as good as it can get with a limited budget. This is by no way a cheap hotel but Manhattan offers shallow Sheraton or Hilton standard rooms for 300 bucks per night, so what can you do? Yes, the rooms are really small, as some comment. But they are cute little rooms, my bathroom had a big shower and a nice minibar. The staff at reception are helpful, the lobby is spacious and \"designy\", I guess it is good also if you want to meet a client in a quiet space. The gym is ridiculously small, it has no windows and a crazy cold a/c running 24/7. I was almost laughing when I saw it, I wondered who would train in there. But hey, Central Park is at 10 minutes from the hotel! I went for a run in the park. Location wise it is quite convenient for business and shopping although it lacks good restaurants. I personally think the best ones are all South of Times Square, more in TriBeCa, Chelsea, etc. So I ended up having to take a taxi and be in a car for 20 minutes every night. The one serious problem I had with this hotel was their wifi. It was included in my room fee for up to two devices and it was the slowest and poorest wifi I have ever had on a business trip. It made everything so much harder, one evening I had to come off their net to look for a restaurant online and pay with my phone to look up stuff on google because their network just wouldn't go! They might say it was a temporary problem but I experienced problems with wifi every day at any time for five consecutive days. Hadn't it been for this issue - which for me is quite a fundamental problem if I'm on business and away from home in the U.S.A. in 2015 - I would have been more generous with my rating. I mean seriously, I've had better wifi in the jungle in Costa Rica.",

      "text": "The Doorman, Jeff, was great. Helped me with transportation and bags, also suggested an affordable good restaurant for lunch, Applejacks. I travel to NYC 3-4 times a year and need to stay in Midtown, so thelocation is ideal, but I consistently have a unpleasant experience during check-in. Upon check-in the girl at front desk was rude and practically indifferent. Arrived at 12:30pm, was informed to come back at 2:00pm and room would be ready. Came back at 2pm, front desk girl said room was still not ready and to take a seat in the lobby, it should only be a few more minutes. After an hour, sitting 10' away from her in one of the lobby chairs reading the paper, I went to the front desk girl, who now seemed annoyed I was asking AGAIN (but it was now 3pm and 60 minutes after she told me to return) she grudgingly looked on the computer and saw a room was ready!!! Had I not asked AGAIN, I wonder how long I would have been sitting there. If the front desk was busy I can understand, but I observed minimal activity while I was waiting. This is the second time I've stayed at your property in the last six months, and I really enjoy the property, just not the front desk clerk. I'm coming back in January and will likely book here again, but I'll avoid this desk clerk if she's working when I arrive. BTW, I'm a traveling road warrior and usually stay at the Hilton on 53rd & 6th Ave, or at the Hampton Inn at 51st and 8th Av, but wanted a change to a boutique hotel. I have also referred people to the property. If the front desk experience doesn't improve, I'll be switching back and not referring.",

      "title": "Seriously??! Does New York City not have public health inspectors?",
      "text": "Without a doubt, the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, outside of India. This hotel was not our first choice to stay during our recent pre-Christmas trip to New York - it wasn't even our tenth choice, due to the poor Tripadvisor ranking this place has received. I'd spent a long time trawling the net for a reasonably priced place to stay in a central location, but every hotel I was interested in was either fully booked, or extortionately priced. So, in the end, with misgivings, I booked the Edison, which still had vacancies in spite of its indisputably brilliant location. We had also noticed that every bad Tripadvisor review was followed by a flurry of excellent ones, posted by \"new reviewers\", who hadn't posted before, or since. If nothing else, the Edison has a well-developed \"damage limitation department\". I wish they devoted their energy to improving the hotel instead. Now, before you think I'm being a drama queen, please take a look at the pictures I took in the bathroom of room 1645. Eeeeeuwwww! If you like your reviews short, stop reading now, and just DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! If you like your reviews detailed, here goes: We booked a double room for three nights, at a cost of $1,085.71 incl. of taxes. We flew in from Munich on a flight that took longer than usual, due to high winds over the Atlantic, and were pretty tired. It took over an hour to get through immigration. We took a cab from JFK to the Edison, where a fed up looking doorman dumped our cases on the busy pavement, and told us to wait. We decided to wheel our own instead, and made our way to reception. The first impression that greeted us was a strong smell of rancid frying fat. We identified the likely source of the reek as the Cafe Edison, which has an entrance just off the lobby as you walk in the door. We made our way to the reception desk, where two receptionists were busy in a private conversation, and ignored us completely for what seemed an age. Finally, in possession of our key cards, we headed for the lift. The public areas were festive and pleasant enough, if somewhat tired, with scuffed furnishings, and large rolls of new carpet being stored on the way to the entrance of the Italian Restaurant towards the back of the building. This was Friday - when we left on Monday the rolls of carpet were still there. Is there really no storage at all away from public view? It's not just about esthetics - why narrow the way to the back door, a potential escape in case of fire? Once we stepped out of the lift on our floor, our hearts sank. Scruffy corridor, patched up paint work, battered radiator covers, hideous institutional pinky-beige paint work, bad lighting, and the room was so vile we headed straight back down to reception. A young woman issued us with a new room key, and even managed to crack a smile when tipped. The second room was the same size and location, but on a higher floor, and the carpet was marginally less revolting. Had we been less exhausted, we'd have gone back down, hopefully \"third time lucky\", but frankly, we just wanted to get some sleep. Thus committed, we felt a bit, well, screwed, for the rest of our stay. We should have looked for somewhere else, but that's not how you want to spend precious holiday time, and we already knew the town was pretty booked. The room contained a standard double bed, with polyester sheets, lumpy foam pillows, and a very pronounced dip in the center of the mattress, that suggested a) this is usually allocated as a single room, b) the mattress is cheap and old. Gross! How many generations of tourists have sweated into this thing? Space was so limited that only one side of the bed had a bedside table. The rest of the furniture was old and scuffed - the sort of stuff that people abandon on the pavement when they move house. On the plus side, it was a dual aspect room with a window on each side, one overlooking the distant Hudson, which was nice. Also, the heater was powerful, and we were toasty in spite of the seasonal drop in temperature. The bathroom doesn't have a proper extractor, but a sort of \"ventilation hole\" with an ill-fitting grille. There was a shower curtain instead of a screen, which must lead to endless flooding and water penetration problems. I have documented the mould and mildew problem in the attached photographs. We had one breakfast in the Cafe Edison, pancakes and bacon, and French toast with bacon. The bacon was pre-cooked, cold and hard, the OJ cheap and synthetic tasting. Cheap white bread, one tiny plastic portion of milk per coffee - thankfully there's a Starbucks down on the next corner. We had one dinner in the Italian Restaurant downstairs. Split-level layout - we were seated at a tiny downstairs table by a totally fed-up greeter, in spite of the place being almost empty. This left us nose-level with the stinky carpet of the upper level. Two waiters kept whining within earshot about the shortcomings of the guy who brings the bread and water. The coat check lady was charming and smiley, other than that our impression was of serious staff dissatisfaction throughout the hotel. If the guest rooms are that depressing, what must the areas be like that are out of public view? I'd hate to work there, seriously. Apart from the hotel, we had a really super time in this gorgeous, exciting city, and enjoyed the sightseeing, wonderful helicopter flight with liberty helicopters, a fun Southern soul food dinner with yummy draught beer at \"Delta\", with super friendly staff and good music, which is in walking distance on 9th, good steak and wine at Capital Grille (also easily walkable), fantastic Christmas decorations everywhere, super views from the Rockefeller Center, amazing architecture, and the not-to-be-missed Grand Central Station. The Woolworth Building, omg, so stunning! The only other disappointment was the tatty sprawl that is Macy's. Please don't stay here, and ignore the \"1 review\" brigade that posts rave reviews. The only plus in this place is the location, if you need to be close to Times Square.",

      "text": "Location An indisputable fact about the Edison Hotel is that it is centrally located for tourists. Its only a few steps to the lights of Times Square and the TKTS booth selling discounted theatre tickets for that day. It's a few blocks from a subway station, so we found it handier to walk to it when we arrived at Penn station, but it was a manageable 10-15 mins with luggage in tow. All the large shops are within an easy walk and there are some good quality, reasonably priced restaurants in the area, despite being bang in the middle of a tourist trap. Rooms New York is an expensive place to stay, and Midtown is the worst as you are paying for location, but \u00a3125 a night for this place was depressing, all the more so as this was a good rate. The positives are that the room was a reasonable size but we had a corner room, which made ours bigger than the average, others we glimpsed looked pokey. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the main room appeared to be clean. However, the carpet had seen better days, it was old, worn and poorly fitted (creased at the edges and coming away from the skirting boards in places). The room was also very noisy - we were on the 16th floor and the noise level from outside would have made you think the windows were open, although they were closed with the curtains drawn! This was particularly unfortunate as on the first night of our stay road works where taking place on the street outside. The bathroom was small, old and had been repeatedly and poorly patched up (e.g. a pipe that had been painted and subsequently started peeling was wrapped in a 'decorative' wire mesh). On first inspection, the bath appeared to be exceptionally dirty around the plug hole. Inspection showed that the marks on the bath were pitting on the surface of the tub that couldn't be cleaned away. Some toiletries were provided but I wouldn't have liked to be relying on them as they were cheap and nasty sachets that weren't sufficient for two people. Everyone will tell you that money spent on a nice hotel in New York is wasted, and I have to agree. We could have paid \u00a3100 a night more for somewhere like the Library hotel, which I imagine would be a pleasure to stay in, but we were staying for 5 nights and you can do a lot of other things with \u00a3500! We did spend a minimal amount of time in the hotel room and while definately not a pleasure, it didn't do me any harm. Food The hotel is attached to what I suppose what would be called a diner. It\u2019s a large room, which has some prominent Art Deco features on the ceiling that the hotel sells itself on, however, the actual seating area is retro and not in an Art Deco way. We ate here for breakfast each morning. It was busy, but it never took longer than a few minutes to get a table. Breakfast was typically around $15 for two and consisted of fruit juice, tea/coffee and pancakes/waffles. The quality was fine, for breakfast, however we didn't eat any other meals there - the dinner menu was unappealing and we were looking for something nicer in the evenings. Value for money In comparison to other cities, I would say the quality of the room and the price represented poor value for money. However, it's New York and having researched the other hotels in that \"nothing fancy, 3*\" range, I would say the rate and hotel represented reasonable value.",

      "title": "Edison Hotel is THE place to stay!",
      "text": "A friend recommended The Hotel Edison for our stay in the Times Square area of New York City. I booked 2 rooms: the 2 queen Classic rooms. One person in our group cancelled at the last minute so I cancelled one of the double queen rooms and was able to get a great rate on Cyber Monday on a single queen room that included pizza! My communications with reservations and concierge in advance of arriving was great - they stay on top of the ball and I was very impressed from the start! I requested our 2 rooms be near each other or on the same floor and the best they could do was one floor apart which was just fine. The double queen room was spacious and the beds were comfy. The single queen room was smaller but very cozy and the bed was also very comfy. Since we were there the first week of December, the heater was on when I got to my room but I immediately figured I would not need it since the room stayed warm enough without it. Through the night I got a bit too warm even with no heat on (being menopausal) so the following night I finally had to turn my a/c on in order to be able to sleep thru the night. I was able to sleep well with the a/c on. I should mention that the week we were there the weather was unseasonably warm for NYC in December. The single queen room had all the basics a person needed except I could not get the room safe to work no matter what I tried. There were 2 ways to use it - with setting a 4 digit code or using a credit card. And I always tried to use it either late at night or before leaving so I never reported it since I did not have time to wait around for someone to come. I should have told them before I left that the room safe did not work so they could fix it for the next person. During my stay I did leave items in the safe but just closed the door and never had an issue with anything coming up missing. (Room 1237 if someone is reading this.) The closet is large and there were lots of lighting fixtures throughout the room. I loved that they had double roll down shades to darken the room adequately for sleep. I never heard my neighbors and I hope they never heard me either. The concierge desk is very helpful and I love that they are not pushy with trying to get you to decide on a play or show. We had arranged a lot of our activities well in advance of arrival so we had an itinerary but we had a few nights open for last minute things we found to do. One was getting last minute tickets from the TKTS booth for the play Misery starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf. The tickets were less than half price for purchasing same day and we were on the 15th row! The Edison Hotel is very close to everything and anything. We walked to just about everywhere. You can get a tour bus at the corner. There are many restaurants in the neighborhood. It was the most conveniently located place to stay without being right smack dab in the middle of Times Square. Concierge also helped us with finding food our first night. They recommended Glass House Tavern which was right up the street and the food was really good. I also had a package delivered to the hotel a few days after we arrived and the front desk had a good system for keeping track of it until I picked it up. The hotel is older but has a lot of character. There was a beautiful Chirstmas tree in the lobby that had lots of wrapped boxes under it but I noticed by the end of our stay there were less and less boxes. I think little children were taking them. The cell phone service in the lobby was not great so you have to step outside to make or receive phone calls. I loved that the hotel has security so you have to show a room key card to go up to the guest rooms. They were consistently good about checking. The door men are nice and will hail a cab for you. The bell guys are great about holding on to your luggage if you have a later flight after you check out. They charge a fee of 50c per bag. There is a nice order kept in the lobby especially during the busy check in/check out hours which helps keep people from bunching around the reception desk. Anyone is happy to help answer questions or guide you to the person who can help you better. Great customer service! There are 2 very nice lobby restrooms but they have air dryers and they are positioned right at the door as you enter so if you have washed your hands, you have to walk across the room with dripping hands to where the air dryer is and then people who are coming in have a hard time manuevering in and out. I hope they move the air dryers and also add paper as an option cause not everyone likes air dryers. I could have easily given Hotel Edison 5 stars except for the lobby bathroom thing and one other thing I noticed. In the double queen room, there is a bathroom mirror and a full length mirror. My girlfriends who stayed in this room were a little bothered that there was not an additional mirror at the desk in the main part of the room. With 2 females sharing a room, doing hair and makeup became challenging for them with having just the one mirror in the bathroom that had good lighting. The full length mirror was by the door with not so great lighting. In contrast, my single queen room had a bathroom mirror, a desk mirror and the full length mirror in a position with good lighting. So the room for just me had more than enough mirrors and the room for more than one person had inadequate mirrors. I hope someone at Edison reads this and takes this into consideration. Wifi is pretty pricey but I am guessing it is same with all hotels in that area. It would have cost like $10 per day (per room - not sure how many electronics you can connect for that price) but I had purchased a mobile hotspot from Amazon and I could add it to my cell carrier by the month so I paid $20 for a whole month of wifi and it worked in the room and in the lobby and I could take it with me and have connectivity anywhere I went. I honestly don't know how good the wifi purchased from the hotel would have been. Otherwise our stay was probably 95% perfect and I will definitely stay here again when I am in NYC! I will also recommend Edison to anyone who plans to travel to NYC! I should add that the hotel has no restaurants but there is a lovely deli up the street - heading towards Times Square - that is open 24 hours a day and you can get just about anything from breakfast, lunch, dinner or midnight snack. There is a seating area upstairs from the deli and they have lots of hot food items (price is $7.49/lb) and a large salad bar as well. We ate there twice during our week. And the pizzas that came with my room was from Carve also at the corner of 8th and 47th - their pizzas are the best. Service is sketchy - sometimes they rush you thru and sometimes they are patient as you try to figure out what you want but the food is totally worth it. Stop in for a slice. You will not regret it. I would like to thank all the staff at Edison Hotel. I passed out little gift bags with holiday earrings that I made and little chocolates to the front desk staff. I had brought them for the reservations ladies but found out that they were at another location. I also left same for our housekeeper.",

      "title": "RUDE STAFF. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. WORST EXPERIENCE",
      "text": "Let me begin by saying that this is my very first time in the New York and we thought it would be great to stay at Hotel Edison for its location. Oh how I was wrong...we first checked-in on 14th May 2015, by Marisela who was lovely and very helpful. However, our room was appalling, probably the worst room I've ever stay in. Considering we were staying in NY with this hotel for 6 nights, I was after something comfortable and decent. Now mind you, I don't ask for much, in fact - I rarely complain about anything. But the room we received was one of the old/vintage rooms, very much like the rooms in the 1950s which would have been fine if it was classy and clean. HOWEVER, our room was old and eerie with holes in the wall. Not only that, but our bedsheets had holes and it was stained. It was disgusting! So I made my way down back to Marisela to provide my feedback regarding the room and she apologised and advised that the hotel is currently under big renovations and re-modelling. Without wasting time, Marisela was very nice and told us we were able to change rooms to a more modern one, but had to wait the following day because there weren't any rooms available. Which was fine, it was just one night in our old and eerie room - I pretty much didn't sleep at all. So the next day, we checked out of our room, and came back in the afternoon to check-in the new room Marisela promised us. We were served by a mature male at reception, and to start off with he was nice and I explained to him our situation. He understood what I meant and he provided our new room cards. But we left the reception, I thought just to be safe I confirmed the room we were promised, his attitude just changed dramatically and told us that we had to pay extra to get upgraded to a better room. When I tried to reply he just kept talking on top of me. HOW BLOODY RUDE. When I finally got the chance to answer, I told him his staff member (at that point I spotted Marisela on reception) over there assisted me yesterday and said I would get a better room. Instead of communicating with Marisela, or confirming with her what I said was correct, he just said WITH ATTITUDE \"well you can go ask her then\". WHAT SERVICE IS THAT? Is that the type of service you provide Hotel Edison, because that is appalling. Your staff requires training. Even though at the very end Marisela did help me re-check in to our new room, I am very upset by the way I was treated. FINAL VERDICT - DO NOT STAY HERE, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Well, I don't think I will ever stay here ever again. We paid nearly $2000 AUD for 6 nights here, next time I will just pay additional to stay somewhere else that is more comfortable and less stressful. Thank you for nothing Hotel Edison. PS: I think your reception staff member, Marisela deserves a pay rise for her helpful service - she's the only reason I gave you guys an extra star. And as for the terrible male staff member I had to deal with, I hope he receives some feedback from management for his service.",

Por la noche hab\u00eda un ruido como si alguien golpeara un tubo met\u00e1lico pod\u00eda durar 45 min. el aire acondicionado hacia ruido parec\u00eda un tractor pero si lo apagabas el ruido de los golpes era mas frecuente . Pero lo que me dejo perplejo fue que las sabanas de la cama eran mas peque\u00f1as que el tama\u00f1o del colch\u00f3n . La primera noche no me di cuenta estaba cansado si de la Almohada que era muy alta para mi al dia siguiente ped\u00ed una en recepci\u00f3n por cierto la persona que me atendi\u00f3 fue muy poco compresiva parec\u00eda que le molestaba que le pidiera otra Almohada . La segunda noche tocaba la manta con los pies me levante para ver que pasaba y sorpresa las sabanas no cubr\u00edan toda la cama entre el ruido dormir echo una bola para no tocar la manta no pegue ojo , llegue a pensar que hab\u00edan echo la cama mal a prop\u00f3sito por pedir la almohada. Al dia siguiente sorpresa al llegar por la tarde definitivamente las sabanas eran mas peque\u00f1as que la cama INCRE\u00cdBLE pero cierto baje a la recepci\u00f3n y pedir hablar con el encargado pero que hablara espa\u00f1ol por que vivo desde hace un mes en usa y mi ingles no es muy. Bueno le cuento lo de las sabanas creo que se llamaba oscar y me dice que es raro que estar\u00e1 la cama mal echa que ahora manda a alguien a solucionarlo cuando vi como hac\u00edan la cama y hablamos con la persona que la hac\u00eda que nos dijo que esa era la forma que les hab\u00edan dicho y que esas eran las sabanas mas grandes que tenian en el hotel . Baje de nuevo y se lo conte a oscar . Sus palabras fueron . Existen sabanas mas grandes llamo a su jefe y me dijo que subirian a cambiarlas y poner unas grandes . Todabia las estoy esperando por que muncan llegaron y nadie me dijo nada . Creo que para que no protestase mas me dio un vale para el desayuno y me ofrecio cambiar de habitacion la primera vez , por lo que pienso que hay habitaciones mejores y peores si tienes mala suerte te tocara la mala y si no tendras una buena . No me cambie por que era la ultima noche y mi mujer estaba cansada y enfadada. Y lo unico que queria es volver a casa . Gracia a el hotel no fue una luna de miel fue de hiel . Por lo que yo si fuera vosotros buscaria otro hotel . No os cegueis por la ubicacion el metro esta bien es facil de usar y hay una targeta de semana cuesta 30 dolares . Deje una reclamacion por escrito pero por la manera de recojerla me da que esta en la basura . I went from honeymoon. The room was 622. No wifi small carpet was dirty misplaced at some points. At night there was a sound like someone hitting a metal pipe he could last 45 min. air conditioning to noise seemed a tractor but if apagabas noise shock was more frequent. But what struck me was that the bed sheets were smaller than the size of the mattress. The first night I did not realize was tired if the pillow that was too high for me the next day ordered a reception by the way the person who served me was very little compressive seemed bothered that he ask another pillow. The second night was the blanket with feet lifted me to see what happened and surprise the sheets did not cover the whole bed between noise sleep miss a ball not touching the blanket non-stick eye, come to think that they miss the bed badly order by ordering the pillow. The next day surprise upon arrival afternoon savannas were definitely smaller than the INCREDIBLE but true bed down to the desk and ask to speak with the manager but to speak Spanish because I live in a one month used and my English is not very . Well I tell her what savannah think it was called oscar and tells me that it is rare is the bed ill check now send someone to fix it when I saw how they made the bed and talked to the person who made it told us that was the way they had been told that these were the biggest he savannahs they had in the hotel. Lose again and conte oscar. His words were. There are bigger called his boss and told me savannas would rise to change and put a large. Todabia the'm hoping that Muncan arrived and no one said anything. I think that no more protested gave me a voucher for breakfast and I offered to change room the first time, so I think there are better rooms and worse if you have bad luck and bad touch you if you will not have a good one. No change for me was the last night and my wife was tired and angry. And the only thing I wanted is to go home. Thanks to the hotel was not a honeymoon was gall. So if I were you I would look for another hotel. Do not be blinded by the location of the meter is fine is easy to use and there is a week Blast costs 30 dollars.

      "text": "We checked in on Saturday evening and had a great experience at check in. Were informed that we'd been moved into nicer room than what we booked which we appreciated. We were here for work for a week, and the central location of the hotel was great. Unfortunately, the room we had had no wifi reception. We enquired at the desk about this because we were on a business trip and it was vitally important that we had internet access, particularly for a three hour conference call we had scheduled for Tuesday night. Reception suggested that they could move us to a different room which had better reception which they showed us. It was clearly a step down from the room that we were staying in (and had a pretty unusual smell as soon as we stepped into the room) so we said that we would try to work out of the \"business facility\" on the 2nd floor instead. We asked whether it would be possible to use the conference room for the three hours since the reason that we would be out there was because we couldn't use the internet. The gentleman at the desk explained that the conference facilities weren't for guest usage, but said that he would talk to management and get back to us sometime the next day. The next day came, and we decided that we should buy a wifi subscription so we could do the call in the evening. Unfortunately, after purchasing a week's worth of high speed wifi, we discovered that it didn't work properly in the business centre either. While it was possible to connect from time to time, the connection was unbelievably slow and insufficient to be able to do a Skype call on. In desperation we went and bought an AT&T wifi hotspot device for $115 which was sufficient for us to use in the hotel room to give us some internet coverage and make the conference call we had to on the Tuesday night. We never heard back from anyone about whether we could use the conference room. We contacted the wifi provider as well and explained the situation to them, asking for a refund for a service that we simply couldn't use and certainly wasn't what it was described as. After several emails we are still waiting to hear back from them to resolve this satisfactorily. In summary: if you're looking for a centrally located hotel from which you can get anywhere in New York easily, this may be the hotel for you. If you're here to do business, find somewhere else as the wifi simply doesn't work.",

Upon further investigation, I found 4 more on the bedspread, one on the desk, one on the wall and one on the ceiling. When I lifted up the mattress to see if any were under it, I found a porn mag (but no more bugs). After calling down to the front desk and waiting 15 minutes for someone to come to the room, we called down again. They told us we needed to pack up our belongings and head down to the front desk. When we got there, we were greeted doubtfully, but were given keys to a new room. We hopped in the elevator, and rode up to another room only to find more bugs (different variety) taking up residence along the baseboards. When the front desk was called, they informed us that they weren't sure if they had another room and we needed to come down to the front desk again! We loaded up our luggage again and I brought a few of the bugs I'd killed with a used metrocard as proof down to the front desk. This time the only response the front desk could muster was \"That's funny.\" I They did manage to find us a THIRD room. Despite not having much interest in continuing our stay at this point, we had nowhere else to go. We spent the next hour going through our clothes to make certain there were no stowaways and trying to rid ourselves of that \"skin is crawling\" feeling and finally got to bed. The good news is that this room appears to be bug free. (I'm writing this from the hotel room without bugs). Beware if you choose to stay here. The location is great but the unwanted roommates are not.",
