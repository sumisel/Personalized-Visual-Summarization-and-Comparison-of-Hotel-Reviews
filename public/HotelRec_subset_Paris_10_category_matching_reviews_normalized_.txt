Small room with very little room to move, it was hard initially getting into the room with our luggage.",

Nice and quiet, beds are ultra comfy. Breakfast was quite nice, puts continental breakfast that we have in Canada on the bottom shelf i can say. WiFi is free but drops constantly, so if you need a good connection for business i would look elsewhere or get a mobile internet stick. Service is very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.",
