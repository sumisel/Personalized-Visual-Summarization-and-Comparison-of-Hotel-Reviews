      "text": "What an amazing experience! Our 5-day Marriott Berlin stay was the best Experience of Berlin. At the check-in The Marriott staff, Nina, heard that we moved out of another M- Hotel nearby (a boutique hotel across Sony Center) where the Check-in Manager treated us with the unacceptable, manipulative sales tactic, although we booked the already paid suite, upon our arrival. Unlike the other hotel, all the Marriott staff showed us the true hospitality with sincerity. Marriott staff greeting us each morning and night, with the eye contact and smiles! - Thank you, Marshall, for checking with us frequently to make sure our stay was smooth. We thank all other staff and managers who stood up for your good reputations in the area! Even the taxi drivers told us they were well aware of the great hospitality. I suggest other guest to try their breakfast, at least once or twice, which has interesting selections of all types of sausages and hams and some pickled fish, and lots of fresh produces and pastries. Before or After the cold day out, it was nice treat to myself to plunge into the pool, then, sauna. The spine-soothing radiation heat chairs were amazing, and, there is a line for that many times. - For the location : The hotel is just a short block away from Potsdamer Platz Station/Sony center(South of Hotel), and Berlin Philharmonie (West Sony Center), and is close to the Tiergarten (North) that has Reistag Dome, Brandenburg Gate & The Jewish Holocaust Memorial (5 min walk). If you are heading to Museum Island, it takes only 5-6 stops, by bus 200 (highlights : Bode, Neues, Pergamon, DDR, Berlin Dome, TV tower in Alexander Platz). For your return trip from this area, I advise you to set Sony Center as your return stop in GPS map, instead of typing in Marriott Hotel, to stay close to this interesting shopping mall/cinema area as your drop-off instead of walking in the vast street across Canadian Embassy. Right from the hotel is Potsdamer Platz station. We find S-subway and RE(Regional Train), direct to Oranienburg (North of Berlin, 25~40 min ride, for the first Nazi Concentration Camp Site) is really convenient, at the foot of the hotel (South) When I first searched for the best locations for our 5-day stays in Berlin, I did not know where to look at, not knowing what neighborhood is good for the tourists. After checking in Marriott Hotel, I could spot other high ranked hotels I was considering, their locations can be subjective to the each opinion and in the less optimal locations, especially with the apartment hotels, but in the quaint bedding communities often, and where the taxi drivers never heard of. For the avid tourists of us, revisiting the city after 26 years, this Marriott in Potsdamer Platz is the new central hub for tourism, considering the shift of the center moving to East Berlin, and, to cover the top 30 ranked tourist places- This area is close to everything, and easy to walk to, with nice neighborhoods, with local restaurants along the way back, and, we felt safe in the short walk, and, mostly bright at night. Our experience in Berlin could have been just the typical cold wet winter one, but, thanks to the Marriott Team, it has become the unforgettable stay. I wish other hotels can benchmark their teamwork. 2 thumbs up!",

      "title": "Great Marriott with an Excellent Executive Lounge",
      "text": "The Berlin Marriott is a modern contemporary hotel with comfortable rooms and public areas and is serviced by very helpful and friendly staff. The hotel is situated in Potsdamer Platz, which is a 2 minute walk from the S-Bahn and 5 minutes from the U-Bahn. It is ideally located for city sightseeing and is a short walk from the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Memorial to the Murdered Jews, the Topography of Terror Museum (free entry) and Checkpoint Charlie. If you love shopping the Berlin Mall and other shopping streets is a short walk. Key Points: A taxi from Tegel airport is 25 euros with tip (approximately a 15 \u2013 20 minute journey). We had adjoining rooms 950/952 which overlooked the red roofs of the tenements of East Berlin and the Berlin Fernsehturm (Tower). These were Executive Rooms, well furnished, very clean, comfortable and quiet. The hotel is safe and secure. You need your room key to operate the lifts to the higher floors. The Executive Lounge is one of the best offered by Marriott. It has unparalleled views across the city, and is quiet and comfortable. Breakfast offers a great choice of food and beverages (both hot and continental). Evening food also offers a hot and cold buffet with a selection of wines, beers and soft drinks. Alcoholic drinks and food are available from 6 pm until 11 pm. I recommend that you upgrade to an Executive Room to take advantage of the facilities in the Executive lounge. You will not be disappointed and it works out value for money. If you intend to visit the Tower, I recommend you purchase the afternoon tea package on line for 19 euros per person compared to 12 euros just for access to the viewing deck. We felt it was better value for money as you had dedicated queues and you enjoy afternoon tea in the revolving restaurant whilst enjoying the sights. Public transport is cheap and accessible. Ticket machine instructions are in English making them easy to use. Train announcements are also in English. We caught the U-Bahn to the Olympic Stadium and to Charlottenburg Christmas Market. Berlin is a lovely destination for a city break. There is a lot to see and do and the people are friendly and helpful.",

      "title": "Disappointing Stay, Poor Management, Better Choices in Center",
      "text": "The property's appearance and my initial impressions were very positive until I arrived in my room which, unfortunately, it was very small compared to standard Marriott and Renaissance rooms in Germany and elsewhere. The so called \"Deluxe Room\" had a very small bathroom and no bathtub. The room overall should have been described as a \"Broscheck\" room and not a standard Marriott room if we were to apply the Hamburg Renaissance's language. I contacted the front desk in hope of remedying the situation for the remainder of my stay. I was told that the \"Superior\" room in Berlin Marriott is actually the comparable room, to a usual Marriott room which I could have for and additional almost 100 Euros per night, for the subsequent nights. This was not acceptable to me as the room was already overpriced given the abundance of hotel rooms in Berlin, compared to most European cities of the same size so I moved to a competitor's hotel in the area. Also, the front desk did not seem interested to even provide the general manager's business card and made every effort to be evasive. Further, the location is not the best if you are familiar with Berlin. There are plenty of hotel choices in the center of Berlin with much better access to restaurants and sites. Additionally, my complaints upon return to Marriott guest relations and the general manager were unsuccessful as none where interested in changing anything about the incident which as a formerly returning Marriott guest, I find a far cry from their promise of quality. There are much better choices if you are not just looking for a familiar name to Americans such as Marriott. It is really a shame how poor management can impact the business of an attractive property.",

      "text": "When travelling to Berlin, I have always stayed at Hilton, after reading many good reviews about this new hotel, I was very curious so I decided to spend half of my time at this hotel, and I wanted to find out by myself if the stay at Marriott Berlin would be worth full. One word if you do not wish to read the complete review, AWESOME, and book with your eyes close without hesitation. I was so impressed, now this hotel become my favourite in Berlin and already recommended it to friends. Location: The hotel is located within walking distance of Potsdamer Platz, many historical sites such as the Brandenburg gate and the German Parliament, shopping centre Arkaden where you can also get cheap food and try different types of cuisine. The metro station is easily accessible within walking distance as well. Parking: On site parking is 30 Euro per night so, if you think it\u2019s too much you might look around for a long-term parking nearby but you will have to walk every time you need your car. Yes, I agree it\u2019s expensive, but not overpriced in Berlin, hotel parking is not cheap and the rate is the same everywhere. So if you decide to use it, it is your decision. To avoid surprises, do as I do, verify by calling or email when planning your trip that way you will be able to make a clear decision without the need to complain. I would also agree on other comments for the hotel to have a parking discount at least for repeating guests. Check-in/ Check out: Was very quick, and professional. Lobby Bar/ Cigar lounge/ working areas: This Hotel has a very nice caf\u00e9 located in the lobby, you can have a drink, read newspapers and you can have a little snack because the caf\u00e9 also has a nice variety of fresh sandwiches and cakes. The Lobby bar sitting area is very large and comfy that way you get more privacy. Marriott Berlin also has a cigar lounge and a working area which is pretty quiet and secluded, located on the main floor near the lobby bar. Executive Lounge: The executive lounge is located on the 10th floor, it has a nice view on the city and the city tower, OK this is the main point not to be neglected if you want to keep ranking high in the review and customer will come back just because of the executive lounge variety, quality and service. The executive lounge is serving breakfast as well but I would suggest using the restaurant since you either have the choice to use the lounge or restaurant at breakfast. But I have to tell you the choice is larger at the restaurant and you will not regret it. From my point of view, Marriott Berlin scored very high, regarding their executive lounge variety, and it should remain like this and serve as an example for all Marriott Hotel and hotel brand without naming them. I mostly use the executive lounge in the afternoon, the choice they had was awesome, every day they had a soup or cream, a choice of pasta, some potatoes or rice, and a choice of a warm meal with meat chicken or beef. The rotation of the meal was often made so food does not last for several hours on the counter, they also had a choice of cheese, salad, and desert, cake (something for everyone). They also have a nice variety of drink such as 2 or 3 different brands of beer in bottle which is really nice, when you travel to another country you expect to be able to try a few different kinds of beer from that country + they did not choose the cheapest one which was very appreciated, you have Pepsi, Fanta, juice, water, white and red wine and they also have an excellent Champagne. If you are missing something just simply asks, service is incredible, fast, friendly and professional. If you are hungry in the evening, you can also get some chips, pretzel, and even gummy bear. Either you have the choice to have breakfast at the executive lounge or at the restaurant; this is another option to never neglect for your customer, for an exceptional experience, I suggest you use the restaurant for breakfast, Executive lounge tips for guests: - You should avoid the executive lounge at opening it\u2019s too crowded, the food rotation is made very often so you don\u2019t have to be scared to eat cold food, rest or food that spend 1 hours on the counter. Executive lounge tips for the hotel manager: - I found the lounge a little bit small, and should have more tables for 2 and 4 guests, the lack of tables was a problem, during the opening, not enough seat for everyone, for example there was 2 people sitting at a table made to accommodate 4 people, so having more 2 person table so you just have to join 2 tables together if you need a table of 4, instead of having a couple sitting at a table made to accommodate 4 persons. I can understand other guess eating standing up because I would not go and sit with someone I do not know to respect their privacy. - I saw many hotels changing the way they serve beer in their lounge by using a beer fountain, like Marriott in Zurich, they said for explanation it was for update but I do not believe it, it is more to save money. Beer taste better in bottle so in the future, you decide to update the lounge and add a beer fountain make sure your guest always have the choice of choosing among a few brands of beer in bottle which tastes a lot better. Restaurant: I did use the restaurant at breakfast, I had the chance to have all my morning breakfast sitting outside, and they do have a very nice table setting outside along the pedestrian street. (By the way this is something that should remain) sometimes I got up early and went to sit outside before the restaurant opening hours having my morning coffee, the chairs were still attached together, the restaurant staff were getting ready for breakfast, they were cleaning the street and they were courteous enough to bring me some cushion for my chair and have a little talk with me, I really did appreciate how they care about the guest. If you booked the executive lounge which serves breakfast as well, I would strongly suggest you go to the restaurant for breakfast unless you need to eat quickly or busy with something else. The restaurant offers an EXCEPTIONAL CHOICE, WOW AGAIN, they do have an extremely large variety of food to accommodate the most demanding customer, upon request Chef will make your favourite eggs, omelette, a large variety of; fresh juice and smoothies, cheese, cold meat, fruits, vegetables, fresh jam, cereal and bread including bagel, English muffin, and croissants and muffins. Roasted potatoes, sausage, bacon, hard broil eggs, hot vegetable. Letting your customer have the choice to choose of having breakfast either at the lounge or restaurant is another thing you should always keep, it weighs a lot on the scale when the time comes to decide to book executive room. Smoking area and cigar bar: The hotel provides a smoking area in front of the hotel with comfortable sitting couch and chairs, being a smoker myself I did enjoy this special corner for us. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to see some other guess not being able to put their cigarette butts in the ashtray or designed area, you have to remember you are a guest and staff are not there to pick up your waste this is just common sense and behaviour. Room: I did book a suite with executive lounge access, nothing more than WOW, I rarely see a suite that big, the suite features a large spacious bedroom with a comfortable bed, a large bathroom with separated bath and shower, a large living and working area , two televisions, a safe, fridge, a lot of storage for your clothes. There is also doors separating the bedroom from the living room offering you more privacy, Excellent for those travelling with kids or family. I have been travelling alone this time it was a lot more than I needed and expected, but it was very convenient and I did not feel squeeze. Everything was spotless. Pool: The hotel has a good size indoor pool, very clean and it was nice to have a little swim during hot summer days along comfortable long chairs around the pool to relax. There is also a sauna, which is not mentioned on their website, some say they have a spa as well but did not notice it, I will check later to confirm. For those complaining about missing towels or items in your room or service, first of all, if there is something missing just call the front desk, I can tell you they are very quick. Regarding the service, there is nothing to complain about just call the front desk and someone will be up in your room quickly, It happened to me a few times and did not expect them to come that fast, it just shows the professionalism and customer care. Well Done! Some customer may need attention or more private service than others if it\u2019s the case you should go somewhere else, you have to understand that sometimes the hotel staff might be very busy or may have a bad day like everyone else, so they will do their best to serve you, I can also tell you that even busy the staff took time to have a little talk with me which was very appreciated and interesting. Remember your attitude and the way you act with people will often reflect on the quality of the service receive and it is pretty much everywhere like this. When travelling I always look at comfort, quality, and accessibility and service, before prices, so for some this hotel might seem to be expensive compared to other hotels in the area, but it offers all the commodities I am looking when travelling, so we can mix leisure and business time adequately. If it\u2019s your first time visiting Berlin and you expect to stay a few days, it worth paying the extra money at this hotel. And do not be scared to give tip when you\u2019re getting a service because they work very hard to keep a high standard it\u2019s very appreciated by employees it also serves a motivation and appreciation. I have to especially thank the following employee for their outstanding service and personality during my stay, beginning with Katharina Ohters the sale agent who booked everything for me before I arrive for her excellent communication and follow-up, Marshal Leiwakabessy, Moritz Lotze at the lobby bar (extremely nice attitude and people skill) and the following individual from the restaurant: Ehab Gaied, Deniz Onerblol, Danilo Duderstadt, and my favourite cook Christian Grund. But I also have to say a big thumb up to every single employee I had the opportunity to meet for being so attentive to detail with a good positive attitude. So I can\u2019t wait until my next trip to Berlin I will definitely stay at Marriott Berlin and I will also bring you more Canadian maple syrup.",

      "text": "We stayed for vacation using points. We also used points to upgrade to the Executive Floor. As a gold member, the only way to be able to use the Exec Lounge was to pay for the upgrade or use points. I am not sure it was worth it, but it was nice. As a gold member, I probably would have received free internet anyway, which is one of the biggest perks of being on the Exec Floor. The lounge was open until 11:00 pm every night. Breakfast was better than average for a lounge. Hot eggs, bacon and sausage every morning plus a large variety of breads, cold cuts, cheeses, etc. Water, Pepsi products and beer were available in a fridge at any time while the lounge was open. Drinks were served until 8:30 pm as well as decent hot food. Usually a main course (i.e. duck, chicken, beef) as well as a couple of hot sides. Also, breads, coldcuts and cheeses also available). Wine and cheese were available until 11:00 pm. We didn't take much advantage of the free drinks/food in the evening as we wanted to experience the food and beer in Berlin. The rooms themselves were very nice. The maid service had a little to be desired (on our first day). The maid did not clean the toilet and didn't replace any of the dirty glasses (as well as didn't remove the dirty glasses). Luckily the lounge was next door and we borrowed some clean glasses from there. The cleaning service on our next 3 nights was much improved. The location is perfect. It is 1/4 of a block off of Potsdamer Platz. The S Bahn (subway/train) is literally outside the back door. The U Bahn is about 1/4 of a mile from the hotel. Both very close. Once you figure out the subway system it is pretty easy. Read the map to determine your 'areas'. You will see ABC areas to buy your ticket. As long as you are in the city, you will only need to use the A B areas. We loved the city, the areas and the hotel. You will find the hotel to meet Marriott standards. It is a Marriott, not a JW or Ritz. But meets or exceeds what you would expect in the states. I would rate it 4/5 starts if I could.",

      "text": "I've just come back from staying a few nights at the Marriott in Berlin. First, the location is great, literally a minute walk from Potsdamer Platz and a short walk to the other highlights in Berlin. The room was also big, and the bathroom was great (love the shower) - but the problem for me was the beds. I've stayed in Marriott's in the US, UK, Austria, Denmark and all have had lovely big, thick, soft beds. These beds were flatter, lower and firmer. I can only assume that these beds were the ones they use in their Courtyard properties and not proper Marriott beds because there was clearly a difference. A room with some sort of view would've also been nice but instead we were facing in to other people's rooms. Never mind. The lobby is wonderful, and the food at breakfast was plentiful. But, again, I feel let down by the service at breakfast. On Monday the service was fine, but Saturday and Sunday was terrible (it was busier then, granted) but the waiters and waitresses seemed far more interested in other tables whilst blatently ignoring us, and don't get me started on the \"Midtown Grill\" restaurant - we were being ignored so much we just walked out after waiting for so long. On a more positive note, after the shocking service from Midtown Grill we ordered room service which arrived quickly and the food was lovely. To sum up, I've stayed in better Marriott's (the restaurant staff should take note of the service in the Vienna Marriott) but it was still an overall pleasant stay. Some better beds would be appreciated though!",

      "title": "Excellent Hotel for Business Travellers",
      "text": "When I travel for business, three attributes are of extreme importance to me \u2013 room cleanliness, ability to have a good night's sleep, and easily accessible and real high speed internet access. For all three of these accounts, the Berlin Marriott Hotel scores quite high. My room (9th floor) was clean and the daily room servicing was excellent. I appreciated that the room had a shower as opposed to some old-style U-bottomed bathtub (an accident waiting to occur). The vast majority of business travelers, much less all travelers take showers, not baths, these days! Although the room could have used a few more electric outlets (such as by the bed to charge one's cell phone), there were sufficient outlets at the desk to finesse the shortage elsewhere. The beds were very comfortable (not too firm and not too soft) with real mattresses and box springs (unlike many European hotels with three inch foam rubber mattresses on top of a hard, wooden base) and I had no issues getting a great night's sleep. This Marriott does continue to offer rooms with real desks and chairs to allow work in one's room. (Some Marriott hotels have been renovating and removing desks and chairs as \u201cunnecessary\u201d accessories, unnecessary for \u201cmillennial travelers\u201d who would rather work \u201csocially\u201d in bars and lounges! Supposedly, Marriott executive management has stopped this trend due to very irate customer feedback!) Internet access throughout the hotel was excellent. My room offered both wired (much more secure) and wireless internet connections. Upload and download speed were never less than 25 mbits/sec, allowing for reasonably demanding on-the-road business use including teleconferencing. Furthermore, there were no crazy logon restrictions or charges \u2013 this is the way hotels should offer internet access. The Berlin Marriott offers a really good restaurant, The Midtown Grill, that offers not only excellent steaks, but a wide range of fish and vegetarian options as well. I was there for spargel (white asparagus) season; their spargel is excellent. Service throughout the facility was excellent and very friendly. For those with access to the Marriott executive lounges, the lounge in this hotel is open a wide range of hours, seven days a week, offering an excellent breakfast buffet, snacks, and drinks. What you should be aware of: Unless you like taking trains, the location is not particularly convenient. Train and taxi access is excellent, though! This hotel is nominally a non-smoking hotel, but a smoking room is located off the lobby from which the stink of tobacco wafts into the lobby and often up the elevator shafts. This hotel should ditch the smoking room (I think that these rooms are subsidized by tobacco companies in Germany). Changes in Marriott's loyalty program over the next half year will mean that \u201cGold Elite\u201d members will totally lose access to the executive lounges (you will need \u201cPlatinum Elite\u201d status for this access going forward). This change can effectively add approximately $50/day to your daily bill due to benefits lost. Marriott should re-evaluate this change. All things considered, though, I strongly recommend this property, especially for business travelers.",

      "title": "A noisy hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "text": "+ the location - If this is a five star hotel, i don't understand it anymore: We arrived in a room at the street sight, a lot of noise, you can't open the window at night... which is necessary as the van in the bathroom works 24/7... this van makes a lot of noise... we couldn't sleep all night long! Besides that, the room was NOT clean. It was also a decrepited room, we think it was because we have a dog! We complaigned: it took us 3 phone calls before they \"finally\" cleaned the room! The day after, we asked for another room, but the front desk manager told us that in the whole hotel the van in the bathroom works 24/7. They asked us to come back in the evening at 5-6pm so we could change room. We were with some friends in Berlin (they stayed in the Crown Palace, not crowed, quiet hotel - unfortunally our dog couldn't stay there, that's why we had to choose for another hotel). We left our friends at 5pm to go back to the hotel. They gave us and the concierge 2 keys: 805 and 905 so we could see the rooms first before we moved. We opened the doors, both rooms had clients. So unprofessional! They didn't know that! We went back to our room. There we noticed that they took private stuff from us, we have our own fork (belongs to a set of 6) to feed the dog. They took it away and they didn't clean the room???? We were frustrated! Again we went back to the front desk. We asked for our fork. They will look for it and give it us back the day we will leave. It was so unprofessional! The front desk manager gave us at that moment another key: we checked the room but the same problem here: the van of the bathroom works 24/7. But here we could open the window at night so you could here these noises instead of the van! So we moved, we lost so many time with our friends... today and yesterday (we had to wait for the cleaning) Unbelievable, when we checked out on sunday, they presented us the full rate!!! We didn't agree... we couldn't sleep the first night, they took private stuff from us, we lost a lot of time... they even didn't know the whole story (how unprofessional of the front desk manager who was working on saturday)... We told the story again. We asked for our fork. They couldn't find it! They apologized. We were frustrated again, the fork belongs to a set of 6. To me, this hotel is so unprofessional!!!! They offered us a lower rate and free garage, but honestly, I had so many stress during my holidays that this 170 euro couldn't help me!!! It was ridiculous. They have to do their core business!!!! Make people happy and let them sleep! It was the fourth time Berlin in the last year, we stayed 3 times in the Kempinski, we will never come back, when we were there we booked our next stay for December in the Kempinski, The Marriott can learn something from them!!!!!!!!!!!! to the front desk manager: you don't have to react on this article, you should have done it that sunday!",

      "title": "Uniquely modern and well-located",
      "text": "I booked directly on the hotel website for two nights in a Standard Room towards the end of April, 2013 and was coming to the end of my tour of the major European cities of London, Paris and Berlin. I\u2019d just stayed in the Swiss\u00f4tel in Berlin and thought that staying in a section formerly part of East Berlin would be interesting. Arrival I arrived via taxi from the Swiss\u00f4tel, which was waiting just outside the Swiss\u00f4tel entrance. Unfortunately, the driver had a tough time locating this hotel and I was told that the streets in Berlin are always changing due to new construction and that buildings are sprouting up so the building housing this hotel was clearly one of the new ones recently built. The street did not show up on the GPS system, as it was new. After an effort and with the knowledge that it was located near other landmarks such as the Holiday Inn, the hotel was finally located. There wasn\u2019t really a proper drop-off area but only the street served for the purpose and I carried the luggage into the hotel. No luggage assistance was provided and it didn\u2019t look like the hotel would provide any in the normal circumstances. The check-in process was friendly but it was clearly not the place for fawning service, much like the Aloft Sentral in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia actually, where I had stayed just a couple of weeks earlier. The area was uniquely styled and made to look like a library but an unconventional and artistically appointed one. The Standard Room I carried the luggage through the lift and into my room. The design of the hotel was certainly unconventional with a trendy and more modern and slightly quirky tone to it all. I thought of the W Hotels from Starwood (as well as the Aloft from the same brand) and the equivalent from the Hyatt brand would perhaps be the Andaz. I liked the design of the room. It clearly had a trendy feel to it and felt clean and certainly was cleaned after housekeeping did their job the next day. The bed was either a queen or king-size one or in between. It was comfortable but like the Swiss\u00f4tel where I had just stayed, seemed on the hard side and I\u2019m not sure if that is a unique German characteristic. The bedsheets and duvets as well as pillows were more impressive than the mattress and felt soft and comfortable. The flooring was quite nice, being a genuine type of solid wood. The workdesk was relatively small and had an interesting hanging lamp above the desk. Internet access was complimentary but only up to a limit and the speeds were quite alright. I had a room with a balcony, which on review looks perhaps larger than the standard rooms as featured on the hotel\u2019s website. The balcony faced the centre courtyard of the hotel and such was the view available from the room. Given the room aspect, there were no noise issues from trams on the street as mentioned in some reviews. However, there appeared to be some noise leakage from the next room, as I could almost make out a conversation while lying in bed in the evening. It was nice to see a Bosch coffee machine and supplied coffee and tea capsules. At first, I had a little difficulty working out how to operate the machine but eventually figured it out. It was nice to see power points in abundance throughout the room. The bathroom bordered on the small but was still more than capable of providing a good shower with a rainshower unit included. My shower didn\u2019t face the bedroom, as in some previous reviewers\u2019 case. Instead, the shower faced the balcony which wasn\u2019t a major issue as I could block off the view outside to the balcony with curtains. It would indeed have been possible to see through to the shower from outside the glass panel but a conscious effort in that direction would have been required. I found the artwork on the shower glass panel to be interesting, as were the other pieces in the other parts of the room. I\u2019m not entirely sure they would be suitable for a younger audience but that would be a matter of opinion. The room on the whole was quite spacious and not really small but the set-up made moving around a little difficult and the format did not really give a sense of spaciousness. My luggage cases were placed near the entrance so out of the way but it did make moving to the bathroom and minibar and tea and coffee area a little more difficult although I note that luggage cases can be stored under the bed if desired. Please note that I have videos of the hotel room available through the link in my profile section. Location and Public Facilities The hotel\u2019s location was convenient although it does depend on what sights are desired. I wanted to get a taste of the former East Berlin and that\u2019s exactly what I received. The architecture in the immediate area could be considered grim by some but that was what I was looking for and it made a nice contrast with the western parts of Berlin. I also appreciated Alexanderplatz nearby, which was huge and quite obviously captured the spirit of a different philosophy and perspective from a now bygone era. Apart from its ability to evoke such a spirit, the square also had convenient eateries and shopping available. I particularly liked the large and imposing Galeria Kaufhof building with its varied shopping inside (I liked the food section). Together with the TV Tower, the buildings certainly provoked an austere sensation. The Mitte area also had newer buildings and I was able to find another supermarket within walking distance. Alexanderplatz also has a subway station (U-Bahn), which can be used to connect efficiently with the Berlin subway and train network. The stop for the Berlin bus city tour wasn\u2019t too far away either. I took breakfast twice in the hotel\u2019s restaurant and found the quality to be good. As was common in Europe, the range wasn\u2019t extremely comprehensive but there was enough there to keep me satisfied. The breakfast attendants were helpful; I somehow managed to spill the coffee over a wide area as I didn\u2019t open the jug top properly before pouring and they didn\u2019t raise a fuss but just helped to clean up the mess. The lobby was stylish but I did notice a crowd of sorts there many times. Perhaps the level of space offered wasn\u2019t quite adequate as it did seem full at times with luggage and persons. The other areas of the hotel were also modern with a unique and creative vibe. Staff Service The staff were helpful at all times. I wouldn\u2019t describe the service culture here as being over-the-top friendly but such a style wouldn\u2019t have been suitable. I asked a few questions and the reception attendant answered them all informatively so nothing really further could be expected. Conclusion It was an interesting stay here with the unique room and public area designs, contrasting quite sharply with the immediate surroundings. Importantly, the hotel provided a sense of comfort and dependability and was certainly a very good base to explore the eastern part of Berlin as well as the city more generally. NOTE: I have videos of the hotel room available through the link in my profile section.",

      "text": "Some hotels come with a price tag which demand glitz and glamour. Some are bargain buckets and look it. This, however, is a hotel which delivered heavily on value for money and yet provided a stay which reeked of quality. The hotel itself is perfectly positioned for exploration of what was East Berlin...and its proximity to the sights and the transport links makes this a great all rounder. So, firstly, the hotel itself... The reception is warm and welcoming - all subtle lighting and tastefully selected ornaments and interior design. The front desk were fluent in English, which saved our classroom German having to be deployed, and very helpful. Our room was not particularly big nor did it offer much of a view (looking down on the street and the tram line below) but it was comfortable and some serious care had been taken in making it functional yet with a flourish of luxury too (swanky coffee machine, for example). The bathroom had a great shower and, to address an issue I've read elsewhere, the design of the window between shower and bedroom is not a problem. Yes, if you stick your snout right up against the glass in the right place you could peer in and spot your loved one on the lav but, quite frankly, why would you want to? And you really have to go our of your way to do that. So don't let that deter you one bit. Breakfast was a nice range of meats, cheese, cooked breakfast, and pastries. The only complaint, and this is pretty much par for the course so not really much of a complaint, was that if you decided to visit the hotel bar then the drinks and food were a little on the pricey side. Much better to check out the huge amount of bars and restaurants nearby where English was spoken pretty much everywhere and the prices were extremely competitive. Location wise. Alexanderplatz is right on its doorstep with its market stalls and plenty of shops. There's also the train station which was a. great value and b. really easy to navigate. We took a day trip to Potsdam on a travel ticket that cost about \u00a37 for pretty much endless use of trams, buses and trains. Genuinely excellent value. There's too much in Berlin to include here, but a walking tour is recommended and the city astonished both of us in terms of a modern city with such a rich, fascinating history. Great city, great hotel. Would highly recommend.",

      "text": "Me and my girlfriend put a lot of thought into choosing this hotel and were exited about our stay for three nights. However, on our arrival it became apparent they had made a mistake with our booking and the deluxe room we had booked was 'unavailable' until the next day. After being given the option of an upgrade the following night as well as a free breakfast, we accepted the circumstances and unpacked in our standard room. Later on that day, there was a problem with our door that prevented it from unlocking. After trying both key cards i went down to reception where i was spoken to in a very condisending manor by a young lad, almost as if he was showing off in front of the reception girls, asking \"have you put the card in the right way\". After making his way upstairs with me to show me how to use a door handle he realised, like id already told him...the lock wasn't working. He called maintenance and a very nice man showed up and fixed it. On our second day we went down to reception to enquire into when our deluxe room would be ready. The girl behind the desk had no knowledge of our circumstance and we had to explain the whole ordeal again. She then made a phone call and conformed we weren't lying to her, then proceeded to search for a deluxe room available, we waited until she told us there was only one deluxe room available on the second floor. Again all of this in a quite condescending way, and as if she had something more important to be doing. At last! we finally had the deluxe room we had paid for, we opened the door with the key card (which was working this time) to find a very big room! Decorated exactly the same as our last room, with exactly the same bed made from two single beds.. never seen that in a \"deluxe\" room. I opened the door to the bathroom expecting to find some of the magic id seen in the photos on the website, it was again a VERY big room, I then noticed the railings beside the toilet and the 'Hospital grey' metal seat in the shower/ wet room. See what they've done here is assumed a nice, young english couple would not know the difference between a deluxe room and a disabled room. Well we do.. It was obviously the disabled room! we've been fobbed off the a disabled room as a deluxe! and to be honest I'm not that happy about it. If you're in your early twenties and English i wouldn't stay here, stay at the holiday inn next door. If you're disabled on the other hand, this place ticks all the boxes Matthew, Room 227 Thank you and Good night!",

We ate at the hotel on night 2 and the food and service was excellent! Breakfast is your typical hotel breakfast with cereal, toast, pastries, hot food, meat and cheese etc! The food is good but if you head down a little later... Around 9am... Then it is really quite chaotic! Earlier in the morning is nice and calm! I'm not sure if they have staff shortages or if it's just not hotel policy to have a designated member of staff to welcome you to the restaurant and give you a brief rundown of its running! I witnessed lots of perplexed guests... Including ourselves... walking around and trying to work it all out for ourselves! Nowhere to sit because tables still needed cleaning! No idea where to get coffee as there were no readily prepared flasks on the bar which we now know is where they live! Same for teapots! As we were leaving today we heard somebody ask for a Cappuccino. We had no idea there was a machine behind the bar offering such delights. It seems the staff serve you these drinks rather than the usual help yourself! Surely we should have been made aware of this on our first visit! I must add that this is no reflection on the TWO staff who work incredibly hard trying to provide this service but they simply cannot keep up with the demands of the guests! If two staff is commonplace then I think it needs reviewing at busy times as I'm afraid this reflects poorly upon the hotel! I'm pleased to say this is the only negative we've found so far and would not stop us from staying again! :-)",

On the downside, the breakfast room layout is crowded, but the most significant complaint is that the bed was one of the most uncomfortable that I have tried to sleep in recently. Although marketed as a double bed, it comprised two single beds pushed together; with already uncomfortable mattresses, the result was very uncomfortable. The addition of a suitably-thick double mattress topper would have addressed this. Another annoyance, familiar to travellers in Germany, is the use of two single duvets as suitable bedding for a double bed: can we have one suitably-sized duvet, please? I would consider staying there again, but the comfort of the bed would have to be addressed.",

Just street parking options. As usual it is the typical highly unfriendly German system where you need to have coins or an EC card to be able to use the Parking meters. Parking is free from 20:00 to 9:00 hours. Check-in process Only 1 person manning Reception at around 19:00 when I arrived. Takes too long. Finally managed to check in. Hauled my luggage all the way to the 9th floor only to find that the room key did not work. Had to come all the way down to have the key reprogrammed. Overall - Check in process lousy! Room Room is adequate. I was upgraded to a Deluxe room which was spacious. Room was located on the back side of the hotel so there was less noise especially from the trams that are passing every 2 minutes on the front side of the hotel As trendy and modern as Indigo brand wants to portray itself, it has a major design flaw. When you enter the room, one has to insert the hotel key in a slot for the power to go on. This slot is not lit. So especially if you are new to the hotel and come to your room at night, you have no clue where to insert the key. Lousy, lousy, lousy! The 2nd day at the hotel, housekeeping cleaned my room and did not give me any Soap or Shampoo! ZERO. I had used the Soap and Shampoo from the previous day and there was still plenty left in the container. Even if they had just left it like that it would have been fine. But no, they removed everything and left me with nothing! Had to walk down to reception to get it replaced. WiFi To log in to the internet, you need your Last name and Room number. They claim it works on 2 different devices.. The 2nd day I was there, the internet stopped working on my phone. I called to Reception and they offered to give me a special voucher with a password to access the internet. This I could only get by going down 9 floors to reception because he was alone! I tried using this voucher and it still was giving me the same error message. I tried switching off the phone and resetting everything and tried the voucher again and got the same error message. I call back to Reception and he says that my phone is defective!!! Funny, the same phone the next day started working fine with the internet without doing anything special. Restaurant Breakfast is a nice spread. Especially liked the Muesli. All the usual suspects like Scrambled eggs, Potatoes, Sausages, Fruits, Cheese, Olives, good selection of bread, Orange Juice, etc. Had the chance to use the restaurant at lunch or dinner times. Extremely understaffed. Very poor service with lousy attention to detail. In several cases when you ask the Waiter for something, your request is treated as an imposition. Takes for ever. Board Room Had to use this for a meeting. Good room with nice features. Quite expensive for the 3 hours that we used it but the facilities were quite adequate. Overall Good location. Good breakfast. But everything else needs improvement. Understaffed. Disappointed. Would not return.",

      "title": "Berlin - Hampton by Hilton Berlin City West - Perfect Hotel, Brilliant Staff",
      "text": "We spent a long time discussing a hotel for my 50th birthday weekend and eventually plumped for the Hampton by Hilton in West Berlin. It seemed to offer everything we wanted for the trip being in a decent spot, close to S Bahn stations, offered a hot and cold breakfast as part of the package and was a really good/decent price. What we hadn't bargained for when we eventually booked it was firstly the excellent location ( even though we had looked at it from a far ). It is extremely close to the very attractive and buoyant area of Savignyplatz, with its multitude of shops, restaurants and bars, and also just up the road from Kurfurstendamm a major shopping area. We originally thought we might be just a little off the originally planned Mitte area, but with such an efficient transport network of buses, underground and over ground trains we needn't have worried. But the biggest plus was undoubtedly the outstanding staff. Really really outstanding in every regard. We arrived early evening and all our rooms ( five in total ) were ready and check in was swift, efficient and carried out with a very warm welcome. My room had been decorated with a few birthday balloons and banners ( great touch organised by my wife with the hotel ) and soon we were back in the bar area to have a few drinks. The staff then came into their own. Great banter, great advice, taking photographs, nothing too much bother and they became instant friends, which was to be followed through throughout our stay. The Hilton Group really have a very special team at the Hampton by Hilton in West Berlin. Our room was on the second floor and we had went for a garden view spot, as we were concerned by the closeness of the hotel to the railway line immediately adjacent. One word on this, we never heard a train our entire time, including watching one pass at the hallway window. So have no worries about the train line at all. The room had a very comfortable bed and all the facilities that you would need. Be mindful to note the wardrobe and bathroom door are the same glass door. You slide the bathroom shut to open the wardrobe and vice versa. No room safe so maybe one little issue the hotel could look at but I found Berlin so friendly in all aspects that this didn't become an issue. They do have deposit boxes behind reception. Downstairs the hotel is of a simple design and layout, well decorated and just about perfect in terms of what you want and need. Reception leads to the bar area turns into the breakfast area and back round the lift and central core back to reception. Very smart and very comfortable. We had a few snacks from the hotel during the evening and a couple of late night pizzas which were delicious. Breakfast was from 7.00 am to 10.00 am midweek and up until 11.00 am on a weekend, which was handy given the reason we were visiting Berlin in the first place. The food at breakfast was self service but always hot where necessary and extremely tasty. Juices, coffee, teas, sausages, eggs, bacon, cereals, fruits, pastries, etc, everything you need to start the day off with a well fed stomach. All in all this place was absolutely brilliant. In all regards. I have travelled fairly extensively and would have this hotel in my top three, and I have stayed at some of the top hotels in the world including the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai and the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. What made it so special were the staff. All of them. I really cannot thank them enough for making my special birthday weekend such a brilliant affair.",

      "title": "Almost the perfect hotel to explore Berlin",
      "text": "I arrived at the hotel at 5:30pm and there were two other guests before me waiting to be checked in. One of them was actually trying to make a reservation at that time, and I waited almost 15 minutes to be checked in because there was only one clerk at the desk. Could have been a longer wait if that specific customer would have been a demanding one, but nonetheless, I found it curious that there was only one clerk checking in guests at that time of the day, although on other different occasions, I saw 2 or 3 clerks at the front desk. I was given a room on the 7th floor overlooking the famous train tracks others talk about, and at first I was concerned about the noise, but when you close the window, you can hear the train slightly, but you do feel the vibrations of the train going by. However, I must have been exhausted from my city trips that during the night, I only heard my alarm waking me up, and nothing else. Nonetheless, if you're in a room next to the tracks, I can imagine this could be a problem, so definitely if you can, call ahead and request a room away from the tracks. I didn't call, but fortunately this didn't turn out to be an issue. The room size for European standards is pretty good. If you're from North America expecting a large room as you find in your countries, be prepared to be disappointed; however, for similar prices in Europe, I have been in smaller, scantier rooms, and no breakfast was served; thus, for me, the room size was big enough, considering the hotel is located in Europe. One thing lacking in the room was a luggage rack, and also, would have been nice if the room had a fridge like most Hampton Inns have in North America. Internet speed registered at 10-12Mbps, but we used the internet late at night or early in the morning. One thing I didn't like about the room was the glass door for the bathroom. If 2 or more people are in the room and you wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, good luck not waking up your other fellow travelers, since the door makes a lot of noise when sliding in. Even though it looks nice and modern, definitely not the most convenient door to have in a hotel room. Also, the shower has this glass type of door which only covers half of the shower floor, and the shower floor was kind of flat, which caused the water to accumulate. Don't think all the rooms have this setup in the shower, but was not impressed by the \"modern\" shower setup. Given some of the bad breakfast reviews on this site, I was actually surprised to find the breakfast to be much better than what you find in a Hampton Inn in the USA. You could choose from the following items: different kinds of boxed cereals and some german cereals, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, sausages or ground beef, different types of salamis, about 3 different types of sliced cheeses, fruit salads, german mueslix, and a basket of different breads. You can have a big meal during breakfast and really skip lunch. I have only found better breakfasts at hotels that charge 12 euros to 20 euros per person per breakfast, so it is amusing to read how others complain about the 'free breakfast' at this hotel. The breakfast room as others have mentioned does get busy and on the room insert it says the busiest time is 9am, but I went down at 8am and 9am and it was busy both times; if you wake up earlier, maybe earlier times might not be as bad, but no matter how busy it was, the staff cleaning tables were always around picking up trays, which actually was pretty amazing because at some point I arrived and not a single table was available, then somebody left, and within a second, somebody was cleaning the place so that I could seat. Also, we noticed that the food was always being refreshed, even though some of the items ran out fairly fast. The biggest hindrance is people not making up their minds about what they want to eat, and instead of stepping back, they stand between two different items trying to decide. Finally, we really enjoyed the location of the hotel because it is conveniently located close to 2 S stations (Zoologischer Garten and Savignyplats), bus stops and U station, Uhlandstrasse. What this means is that you can take bus 109 from Tegel airport to Uhlandstrasse, and then you can walk to the hotel in 5 minutes, depending on how long the traffic light holds you back. Or you can take the X9 bus from Tegel airport to Zoologischer garten, and from there you can walk 10-15 minutes to the hotel; or once you arrive at Zoo Garten with the X9, catch the 109 and go 2 stops to Uhlandstrasse. It is easier just to take the 109 from the airport though, at platform 4. Once you're settled in the hotel, you can take the 109 bus from Uhlandstrasse bus stop and go 2 stops to Zoologischer garten, and from there, take the 100 or the 200 bus, which start at Zoo Garten, to access most of the sites in Berlin. In other words, you can basically get anywhere in Berlin, just by walking 5 min to a bus stop, and transferring buses to your desired location. By the way, you can just walk to the Zoo garten station from the hotel to catch the 100 or 200 bus. Furthermore, if you want to go to Potsdam, you can either walk to Savignyplatz and take the S7 train to Potsdam, or take it from the Zoo garten. In short, you can get anywhere from this hotel without even having to walk so much. And what we enjoyed the most is that you can stroll to a nice neighborhood, and there on Mommsenstrasse 9 , you can find a top rated restaurant here on tripadvisor, Marjellechen. This neighborhood is worth checking out because of the nice apt buildings, and because of the many restaurants around. Also, there is a Kaiser supermarket on Mommsentrasse or down in Uhlandstrasse, in case you decide to get snacks to take on your day trips. Thus, I recommend you pull up google maps on your browser, and walk around Knesebeckstrasse and Mommsentrasse. Talking to other guests in the hotel during breakfast, many had no idea about the neighborhood, and were complaining how dull the location of the hotel was. Poor souls didn't go out and venture, and thus, missed out on checking out one of Berlins poshest neighborhoods, which is 3 minutes away from the hotel, and you get there, by walking on the alleyway, underneath the train tracks. If you decide to stay at this hotel, explore the hood, and you'll be in for a nice surprise.",

      "text": "This hotel is not hard to find, and its new - the first Hampton Inn in Germany. It is sparkling clean from the moment you walk in, all the way to your room. The rooms are spotless, and very well equipped with power outlets (some hotels in Europe are extremely stingy with power outlets). Reading lights on each side of the queen size beds if you wish to read without blinding your partner. All rooms have a cube radio/clock with alarm. We were initially placed in rooms on the first floor looking directly at a railroad line, and we could see every single train that entered or left Berlin - and there are a LOT of trains every few seconds!. Although the windows are triple glazed, you can still feel the vibration and a mild distant 'light rumble' from trains, so we asked to be changed to rooms not facing the rail line. The front desk changed us with no problem. All of the rooms have showers, so if you're wanting a bath tub, this is not you're hotel. The hot water in the showers is instant and strong, no waiting for the water to warm up. The shower and sink have pumper type soap, shampoo and conditioner with a nice smell, but we still prefer to take our own. The TV's are flat screen HD with a broad selection of channels, and several English channels. You can also select the \"language\" from the menu. The staff at this hotel is remarkably well trained, and very prepared to serve their guests, and every problem is solvable. You don't get a strangle look, or the feeling that you're annoying the staff with ANY question or request you have. We drove to the hotel and parked in their underground parking garage - 12 euros per day (reasonable by Berlin standards, since most charge nearly twice that much). They don't hassle you with the 24hr rule for parking - big asset. There is bike rentals directly outside the door to the hotel. You can rent by paying the front desk - super convenient. We rented the 2 remaining bikes (8 euros per bike for 4hrs) but they don't hassle you or nickle and dime for slight overtime usage. The breakfast buffet at this hotel is incredible for an economy hotel - it far exceeds the breakfast you find at Hampton's stateside. But the breakfast area gets ultra busy at peak times 9am - 10am. Despite the jam packed dining area, the staff was always monitoring the food and replenishing, and also opening up overflow dining areas to accomodate everyone. There is a small fitness center in the basement, with a few pieces of workout equipment and dumbbells. There's a bathroom, sink, and large water bottle w/cups along with fresh apples and towels. Access to the elevator, gym and other facilities requires a room key for control - good feature. The bathrooms near the bar are surprisingly sparkling clean, so someone is doing a great job keeping the place tidy. The bar is almost an extension of the check-in desk, so you can order a drink at anytime. The staff at this hotel is young, ultra friendly, extremely well informed, and know the city to provide directions to sights, or for making recommendations regarding public transportion. The hotel is located near two key subways stops, bus terminals, and tram stops, giving you access to the whole city. This is one of the best economy hotels I've ever stayed in and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a great night's rest in a large comfortable bed, in a clean, safe environment, good location, and with terrific support from the staff, for a very reasonable price - we payed 80euros for a double. It rivals the service of a 5 star hotel without the luxury or expense, but it exceeds the service and comfort you expect from many 4 star hotels.",

LOCATION Hampton Hotell is located in the most \"French\" (beautiful) area of Berlin very close to Sevigny Place and Kurfurstendam. The street itself (Ulandsstrasse) is however not much of interest and the hotell offers nothing that could boast like a view. We booked rooms heading towards the \"garden\" which was a smallish backyard. HOTELL Hampton Hotell offers most off what you need but without the silverlining of the sister chain Hilton. The rooms are really nice and modern and clean (I didn't even think the word when there as there was no need to worry) and with nice, modern bathrooms with showers, minibars, tv and a sofa. Everything was clean and well cleaned well all three nights that we stayed. Breakfast was good, better than expected with all kinds of foods you would want (3 kinds of eggs, sausages, fruitsalads, beans, juices, milkproducts, cereals, coffe and the etc). The room dod NOT hold safty deposit boxes instead guests can use safty boxes located in the reception. Check out was effective. STAFF The hotell is run by every LEAN management principle known - and therefor the staff is very friendly but slip sometimes as they are stressed to following procedures. Don't expect personality but polite and friendly proffesionalism - both regarding reception and breakfast staff. We asked for directions at the reception one day, as we wanted to visit the Bundestag and the staff gave me directions and opening hours off the top of their mind but did not tell us that pre-booking on he internet was required. We therefor found the parliament building but missed out to enter it - I had wished for better information here. GYM the gym held about 5 machines, 2-3 matts and a tv, all located in a very clean and modern room in the basement. No especiall joy of life but enough to keep fit during yor stay. If you are a jogger I would strongly recommend jogging through the streets to the Tiergarthen park (daytime as the park is not lit during night). RETURN AGAIN Would I return? Yes, definitly if my budget was avout 90 euros/150 dollars a night for clean, modern and proffesionally run and well taken care of establishment - but if I wanted more luxury I would choose another hotell.",

      "text": "This hotel is not hard to find, and its new - the first Hampton Inn in Germany. It is sparkling clean from the moment you walk in, all the way to your room. The rooms are spotless, and very well equipped with power outlets (some hotels in Europe are extremely stingy with power outlets). Reading lights on each side of the queen size beds if you wish to read without blinding your partner. All rooms have a cube radio/clock with alarm. We were initially placed in rooms on the first floor looking directly at a railroad line, and we could see every single train that entered or left Berlin - and there are a LOT of trains every few seconds!. Although the windows are triple glazed, you can still feel the vibration and a mild distant 'light rumble' from trains, so we asked to be changed to rooms not facing the rail line. The front desk changed us with no problem. All of the rooms have showers, so if you're wanting a bath tub, this is not you're hotel. The hot water in the showers is instant and strong, no waiting for the water to warm up. The shower and sink have pumper type soap, shampoo and conditioner with a nice smell, but we still prefer to take our own. The TV's are flat screen HD with a broad selection of channels, and several English channels. You can also select the \"language\" from the menu. The staff at this hotel is remarkably well trained, and very prepared to serve their guests, and every problem is solvable. You don't get a strangle look, or the feeling that you're annoying the staff with ANY question or request you have. We drove to the hotel and parked in their underground parking garage - 12 euros per day (reasonable by Berlin standards, since most charge nearly twice that much). They don't hassle you with the 24hr rule for parking - big asset. There is bike rentals directly outside the door to the hotel. You can rent by paying the front desk - super convenient. We rented the 2 remaining bikes (8 euros per bike for 4hrs) but they don't hassle you or nickle and dime for slight overtime usage. The breakfast buffet at this hotel is incredible for an economy hotel - it far exceeds the breakfast you find at Hampton's stateside. But the breakfast area gets ultra busy at peak times 9am - 10am. Despite the jam packed dining area, the staff was always monitoring the food and replenishing, and also opening up overflow dining areas to accomodate everyone. There is a small fitness center in the basement, with a few pieces of workout equipment and dumbbells. There's a bathroom, sink, and large water bottle w/cups along with fresh apples and towels. Access to the elevator, gym and other facilities requires a room key for control - good feature. The bathrooms near the bar are surprisingly sparkling clean, so someone is doing a great job keeping the place tidy. The bar is almost an extension of the check-in desk, so you can order a drink at anytime. The staff at this hotel is young, ultra friendly, extremely well informed, and know the city to provide directions to sights, or for making recommendations regarding public transportion. The hotel is located near two key subways stops, bus terminals, and tram stops, giving you access to the whole city. This is one of the best economy hotels I've ever stayed in and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a great night's rest in a large comfortable bed, in a clean, safe environment, good location, and with terrific support from the staff, for a very reasonable price - we payed 80euros for a double. It rivals the service of a 5 star hotel without the luxury or expense, but it exceeds the service and comfort you expect from many 4 star hotels.",

      "title": "Best bargain on our whole trip!",
      "text": "We (family of 4 incl. two older teens) spent a month in Europe and I would have to say for the Euros spent and the class of accommodations and service returned the Mercure Hotel & Residenz Berlin am Checkpoint Charlie was by far the best deal on our whole trip. At 137 Eur per night prepaid including taxes with no cancellation, no other hotel we stayed in came close, particularly in price, cleanliness and appointments. The Mercure Hotels is a mid-level price hotel chain which is part of the umbrella chain of the Accor Hotel Group which includes the Sofitel, Novotel, Mercure, Suitehotel and Ibis hotel chains as well as a number of others. The hotel itself is at the northern edge of Kreuzberg, one of the districts of Berlin (one fantastic city by the way), that has been undergoing renewal for the last 15 or so years (as many formerly East Berlin districts are doing). This one happens to include what was Checkpoint Charlie and remnants of the Berlin Wall which are only 3 blocks away from the hotel. The location is really quite good and it was quiet, day and night. The building itself if fairly new, but then so many newer German buildings are so well built (I'm an architect) and maintained, it could be 10 years old, but seem like 3. It is part of an entire city block that was redeveloped with several internal courtyards which the hotel looks into. The block itself was designed by one of Italy's most renowned contemporary architects, Aldo Rossi. The Mercure Hotel moved into this block about 3 or 4 years ago from what I was told. In the immediate area are a few nice restaurants (a nice German/ French restaurant called Entrecote is a block away) and there are quite a few cafes and local eateries and Starbucks around Checkpoint Charlie. To the north about 4 - 5 blocks is a trendy restaurant and bar neighbourhood on Charlottenstrasse which includes the Helmut Newton bar with it's titillating supergraphic and the classic Lutter and Wagner Restaurant serving good higher end German fare. Parallel and a block west of Charlottenstrasse is the classy shopping street Friedrichstrasse which has a bit of a 5th Avenue feel and includes Galeries Lafayette and a lot of designer boutiques. Transport is close with S-bahn stops (buses) and U-bahn stations (underground) at Checkpoint Charlie. There are also S-bahn stops 2 blocks to the north on Leipzigerstrasse. With these you can go virtually everywhere in Berlin making for easy access to all the popular tourist sites, cultural venues, parks and shopping districts. Our hotel room was on the 6th floor with the 7th being the top. We basically had two large full bedrooms fully carpeted connected by a wide corridor off of which there was a full tiled bathroom and a powder room and the entrance. We had two TVs and since the suite spanned the width of the building, tilt and turn windows at both ends of the suite. The suite was very comfortable, spacious and clean. All the appointments in the room were of good quality and worked well. The mattresses were ok, not sumprtuous by any means, but very adequate. We never ate any of our meals at the hotel even though the breakfast buffet looked tempting. However this is where I make my only gripe about the Mercure Checkpoint Charlie and that is the price of 16 Euro for the breakfast buffet, which was the only choice. As we found in our research and travels in Europe, hotel breakfasts are very expensive, at least compared to what we are use to in N. America. True to German tradition, there is a well managed bar off the lobby that caters to patrons late into the night. Internet was available in the lobby on the house computer, which was at times occupied into the late evening hours. Staff were attentive, spoke very good English and were always eager to show you where you wanted to go. The hotel did not seem particularly busy in late April, but people were always coming and going. It's not a convention hotel and I don't recall seeing an exercise area. Would I go back? Yes and no. Berlin is a must see so I would certainly go back to Berlin. If value was a top priority Mercure Checkpoint Charlie is a no brainer. Knowing the lay of the land now, I might choose a different location just to get a different flavour as there are so many different neighbourhoods in Berlin, like Paris's arrondissements. You won't be disappointed with this hotel if you get a good seasonal rate. If it was 200 Eur, there would other selections to consider including other Accor Hotels. Oh and two of many must dos. Go to Ka De We department store to the food floor, it's a gourmet's fantasy and take a Fat Tire Bike Tour (Berlin is dead flat with dedicated cycling lanes) from the base of the Fernsehturm (huge radio/observation tower), it's better than an open bus tour.",

You don't have to but this hotel really does give you access to everything. The rooms are superb, we had a family room with 2 double bedrooms, a super bathroom with wet room style shower and a bath with a separate toilet. The bar is well stocked and the wine is available at two prices, the in bar price and the in room price which is basically half the cost of the bar price. The staff are all helpful and friendly and the breakfst buffet is very good. I was really surprised and more than impressed with this hotel. Excellent value for money and everything you could want.

      "title": "Read my room tips!",
      "text": "If I had either by intent or happenstance avoided the problems with the rooms, the hotel would have gotten four stars. Read on to avoid the same issues by requesting a room that doesn't have the issues that are of concern to you. 1. Some rooms just plain don't get wifi. Hotel is well aware of this (according to the front desk clerk). Be sure to ask for a room that actually gets wifi in the room. It did seem to be available in hallways and common spaces all the time, but not in my room ever. After complaining several times, the manager did give me a discount for inconvenience. 2. The hotel is actually two buildings. Getting from one building to the other can be done indoors, although it is inconvenient. You have to take an elevator to the 4th floor, walk down the hall to get to the other building (the Residenz), then take another elevator up or down to your room (unless you happen to be on that floor). Second building (without front desk) also has a door at the street level, which was easier. This is really more of an inconvenience if you have mobility problems. 3. At least one room has stairs WITHIN THE ROOM. Yes, a sitting area downstairs, bedroom (with two porthole-like windows) upstairs. You would have to carry your luggage up the room stairs. Especially if you have mobility problems, this is an issue. They did move our traveling companions (who could not walk stairs) to a different room. 4. It appears that there are two rooms in the Residenz that are one floor up from the highest level that the elevator goes. You would have to climb those pretty steep stairs every time. 5. Another mobility issue: our room had a tub with the shower in the tub. The tub is typically European, long and deep but narrower than a typical US tub. If you have trouble stepping into a tub with very high sides, this would be a problem for you. It wasn't a problem for us, but we were traveling with others who would not have been able to use this tub. However, all in all, the hotel itself was really very nice. The rooms were pretty, nicely appointed and comfortable (well, except that room with the stairs to the bedroom). We had no problem with noise at all, either from outside or other rooms. Location was great for us (and sightseeing in general), not far from Checkpoint Charlie and the subway station there. There are coffee machines in each room that actually have really good coffee to make your own. And I will also point out that the hotel took steps to help us with all of our problems with the rooms. On the \"minus\" side in general, some of the front desk staff really didn't care much about customer service. I asked twice (on two separate days) to speak to the manager, who was not there either time. After I spoke to the second front desk person, the message got to the manager. Although I never spoke to the manager, the clerk took care of it. One clerk was especially helpful, looking things up for us on the Internet, printing maps, making restaurant recommendations and reservations. Others far less so. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, we thought we could do better than 18 Euro a person at nearby cafes. Our favorite was Junge Die Backerei (reviewed separately). Even with some of the downsides, I think you can have a very nice stay here, especially if you avoid any of the issues that we encountered. I would stay again, with specific requirements for a room.",

      "text": "Great location, near Checkpoint Charlie, quiet, walking distance to most places and good public transport links; we booked through a flight-hotel-package and it was between this hotel and another, I am glad I picked this one. The check-in process was simple, I was expecting to leave our luggage in storage and coming back for check-in time; however, I was told we can check-in early if one of us signs-up for their rewards programme, which I did. Our booking did not include breakfast and we paid \u20ac18 per day, per person, for breakfast; I was told this can be booked daily if wanted although I paid for it upfront when checking-in. Our room was fantastic \u2013 large room, robe/slipper kit, toilet and shower separate, shower stocked with everything (toiletries, tooth brush, tooth paste and vanity pack), good-size desk with coffee \u2013machine and kettle, two large glassed Evian bottles, decent-sized sofa-bed to accommodate a third adult or two young children, balcony, room safe and large wardrobe. The hotel does not allow smoking but one can smoke on the room balcony, there is a protection sheet covering all the hotel balconies, two chairs and even an ashtray. With our booking we also had a room booked on the first floor, unfortunately at the time of booking they did not have a single-room next to a double-room; this room did not have a balcony and the window was facing a restaurant and an area with public benches. The room itself had most of the aspects of the double-room excluding the balcony; the other differences were that the room was smaller and had a single water bottle. The wifi was slow most of the time, sometimes I ended up using my mobile phone data instead as the hotel wifi too slow at time, there is an option for faster wifi which has a surcharge; with my mobile phone contract I can use my data allowance in the EU. There is an ironing room on the 6th floor, near room 616; one\u2019s room entry pass is needed to enter the room, there is a single industrial-style steam-iron. The fitness and spa area is open 24-hours, there are two treadmills, sauna, an individual steam-room and showers; with the sauna front-desk require an hour\u2019s notice to increase the temperature. On the ground floor before the lifts is a tourist wall with leaflets and information cards that cater for all guests with information about attractions and sites in Berlin. The breakfast options were on par with what one would in most European hotels (excluding the UK) with the exception of their tea options, they have a variety of fresh teas which were nice to have after breakfast. The breakfast staff were attentive by checking with people things were fine with the service and ensuring that they have enough food and drinks out. The hotel does need a larger space for the breakfast service, during the week was fine but on Saturday it was very busy and this was off-season; during holidays periods (e.g. summer, school, xmas, etc.) it would be even busier. The staff were great throughout our stay, from check-in/out staff, breakfast staff, to room staff, etc; staff can have a major impact on one\u2019s stay and the staff made our staff enjoyable. All front-desk staff spoke good-English, the breakfast spoke English or understood enough for us to communicate with them and the room-staff understand enough English for us to communicate with them. Check-out process was even more straight-forward than check-in, front-desk ordered us a taxi to Tegel Airport straight-away. Overall a great stay, the slow wifi was the only negative aspect; nevertheless, highly recommend staying here if in Mitte.",

      "text": "I had a particularly unwelcoming and nasty check in experience. After travelling 17 hours from KSA to Berlin, I arrived at the hotel at 1 pm approx. on Friday 17 August. I was given a room, but when I saw it, discovered it had two single beds in it. As I had booked a 5 night stay, and requested a king size bed, I was disappointed, so after phoning reception, I went back down to politely ask if they can give me a king bed. After that, it all went wrong. The girl and acting duty manager were beyond rude to me. I was told that I was not guaranteed a king bed, which I accept is true, but as a paying guest, I have the right to request one. They made me feel because I booked with expedia, that I had no rights at all. I said I am staying five nights, I cant sleep in a single bed. The duty manager actually had the audacity, while he was serving another customer, to shout out to me WHY NOT and gave me the most filthy look. The girl on reception who was now dealing with me was most rude also. The duty manager then said if you want a king bed I will downgrade your room then in the older part of hotel. By this stage, I was almost tearful, I was so astounded at what way they were dealing with me, and I was exhausted. He came over then and they found a room with a king bed, the girl gave me the key to go and look at it. it was absolutely fine, so I left my case there and went down to tell her it was ok, expecting that to be the end of the matter. Then another drama started that I couldn't have it to 3 pm. I said the room is ready and I have left my bag there, she was furious. she and the duty manager said the room isn't cleaned, I said it is I have just been in it. with a very bad grace they let me have it then, as they couldn't really justify any further argument. Maintaining my dignity and manners, I thanked them very much, which was much more than they deserved. It left a very very bad taste for the start of my holiday. I have not slept in a single bed for more than 30 years, and come to a hotel for some luxury, not to suffer in a single bed for five nights. The hotel itself was very clean and nice, but sadly I could not return, because of these two employees, who felt it was ok to speak to a single female like that, and make my experience was unfriendly as possible with no good reason. I cant believe they are actually allowed to be on front desk, their manners are better suited as janitors. I have stayed in five star hotels all over the world, and can honestly say, this hotel was the worst I have ever arrived at, in terms of unprofessional and unfriendly rude check in staff. For my check out, to be fair, that employee was perfectly fine and even gave me a chocolate. I was in room 626, the pillows were very hard and uncomfortable, a minor issue, and also a bad smell coming up from the sink in the bathroom. Housekeeping very good at cleaning and replacing the toiletries. Location was excellent, restaurant rather overpriced - I was charged 13 euros one day for a small portion of French fries.........!

As the headline says it is a great clean well located middle range hotel (thin towels and all) let down by it's internet - here is the text of the email reply I sent to one of the many emails I got - Thank you for your reply. I would prefer not to discuss it on the phone - I can identify the problems I had in an email. The problem is one that many hotels have so you are not alone. It has got to the point that I and many people I know would prefer to pay for breakfast or even pay for using the shower that pay for internet access. The free internet wifi in the lobby did not work for my laptop (win xp) or my android phone. This may be because the system can only have a certain number of people using it at one time - in which case the phones of the staff and the weather ipad on the counter should be disconnected to allow guests to use it. Alternatively it could be becuase the router is an n router and some computers etc use g or b- in which case the hotel needs a new router that accommodates b and g wifi. The internet in the room was a good speed for me (I heard one guest complain that the upload speed was not good enough for sending his photographs for work and he would have to go to another hotel the next day). Unfortunately, I was unable to connect my android phone - I think because the system required me to leave a browser window open - which does not seem possible on an android phone. The night I arrived in Berlin I stayed at Intercity Hotel at Schoenfeld airport. The package had free internet but I had to pay for breakfast if I wanted it. (They also had an English language newspaper, unlike mercure Checkpoint Charlie - which only had a sheet of paper from some company in Liverpool). I was able to connect whenever and wherever I wanted in the hotel -I did have to log in which was a little annoying but I understand that hotels have to have some security and restrictions on their internet.The internet offering in that hotel was much nicer than the one in the Mercure and you might want to look into how they do it and copy them. I can say that apart from the internet (and to a certain extent the orange carpet - which is not to everyone's taste and the lack of a door on the shower and no English newspapers) I had a really good time at the hotel - the room was great and clean; the bed comfortable; the coffee machine in the room made great coffee; the location fantastic; the staff very friendly; I could say many more good tings about the hotel. But the poor and frustrating internet negates all that - I would not stay again if the internet was not much improved. Maybe this is an opportunity for Mercure and Accor to do something well that many hotels do badly and maybe become known as the hotels that give fast and free internet to all their guests.

      "text": "We spent a lot of time on which hotel we should book for our 2night/3days in Berlin, where he was also going to celebrate his birthday. Making up our mind was difficult. We had wittled down our list to two hotels - The Adlon and Das Stue. Should we take a classic hotel, which was similar to the other two hotels we had chosen in Oslo and Stuttgart, these destinations were part of the same itineary, or should we break the mold and check into a design driven hotel? What spoke for The Adlon was the Leading Hotels of the World membership, the location, being in the center of everything, having a wide selection of restaurants including Sra Bua, which we always wanted to try (and still have to in our future), the heritage and the prestige. What spoke against it was the location, the prestige and the value. We were already quite busy in Oslo and Stuttgart. We thought we would overdo it, if we were out and about in Berlin too and it would be more suitable to have a celebratory and quiet birthday. Having experience how overrun some famous hotels, for example The Arts in Barcelona, can be and how even staying guests are treated, we were a bit wary. We also followed the reviews on Trip Advisor. There were indications we might not be able to enjoy our stay to 100 % at the Adlon during this time. Our stay was from a Saturday to Monday. We were comparing rates and found out that The Adlon was available during the week for half the price when booking an entrance category room, so we thought it wasn't worth to spend much more for the same category. Of course we know rates are demand driven and that Berlin is a weekend destination. As a note: Some Berlin hotels up their rates during weekends, while others require a minimum stay of two nights we found out during our research. Das Stue had a slightly higher rate on the Saturday to Sunday than Sunday to Monday. What spoke for Das Stue? We had followed the progress since we heard about the development of the hotel. Das Stue opened in 2012. We liked the contemporary design, unusual concept and playful elements. We also liked the membership. The hotel had joined Design Hotels. Das Stue was our first. Even though the hotel was new the building has a history. It was opened in 1939 as the Royal Danish Embassy. The architect was Johann Emil Schaudt, who was also responsible for the Kaufhaus des Westens (short KaDeWe), Germany's largest and best department store. Later the building was used as a training center for Deutsche Telekom and the Postal Service. When Das Stue, which is Danish and means the living room, was redeveloped as a hotel, different architects were engaged. Axthelm Architekten from Potsdam was responsible for the modern extension. The public spaces were designed by Patricia Urquiola and the rooms by LVG Arquitectura. Patricia Urquiola is Spanish, but lives and works in Milan, while LVG Arquitectura is based in Spain. We also liked the dining concept, which includes two restaurants, Cinco and The Casual, and Das Stue Bar by Paco Perez. The location of Das Stue was also good. On the one side it was in a quiet residential upscale neighborhood and near embassies; on the other side it wasn't too far from the zoo, Kaiser Wilhelm Gedaechtniskirche, the Kudamm and the KaDeWe. We thought Das Stue was a better fit for our needs and had to decide what room type to take. We were considering the Embassy Room or Junior Suite. In the end we thought the Embassy Room was large and if we were able to get a balcony too, which is offered in selected rooms, we would be very happy indeed. We contacted Das Stue via email and advised them about our wishes and the anniversary. Since rooms with balconies are rare, we weren't promised anything. The replies were warm and very quick. We took a taxi from Berlin Tegel, arriving from Oslo with SAS. It was an enjoyable flight. The taxi journey took approximately 20 minutes and the cost was slightly below 20 Euro ca. (22.25 USD) each way. While the facade of Das Stue is classic, the interior isn't. We were greeted by a crocodile (sculputre), a reminder tha the hotel is bordering the zoo, and a long stylish hallway. It was filled with natural daylight and there was also a contemporary seating area and the original staircase. The staircase was beautiful and the views from the top amazing. There were books and magazines on each landing. Guests can make themselves comfortable at the many designer seating arrangements and order drinks or some snacks, while browsing through the libraries. The concierge and reception were hidden from view to the left and right underneath the staircase. Check in was very friendly and fast. The receptionIst remembered the birthday. When all formalities were behind us we were accompanied to our room. We were given a brief tour and then left to explore it. The room was dominated by the large bed, which was on the harder side, but very comfortable and allowed for a good night's rest. The design was clean cut, stylish, luxurious and comfortable. The color scheme was black, brown, grey, gold and cream. There was a touch screen for all light features and the airconditioning - it took a few attempts to understand how it worked, but after that it was easy. Our room had wooden floors and very high ceilings. To our delight we also had a fully furnished balcony with views over the residential area and the Tiergarten. We spent there considerable time. We were lucky with the weather during our stay. It was warm and sunny. Another favorite place was the seating area with a contemporary chair, coffee table, a colorful carpet and reading lamp. There were also electronic blinds and two telephones - one was cordless, both by Jacob Jensen. The writing desk was large with an Apple TV, which was very sensitive. The contemporary writing desk chair looked like sitting a long time would be problematic, but it was the whole opposite. TV channels were varied, ranging from local ones to Asian, including the complete line up of Sky Germany, Arirang, BBC World, CNN, Bloomberg and much more. Our artwork was a bit unusual. One was a woolen giraffe in all imaginable rainbow colors, raging from blue to orange, a photograph of a windblown curtain and a painting of an ostrich, playing tennis. The mini bar was very tempting and fairly priced. We loved especially Charitea, the coconut water and Candy Kittens Sours . Snacks start from 2.50 Euro (ca. 2.80 USD). Alcoholic beverages included Mama Vodka, three types of Gin and a half bottle of Louis Roederer Champagne, which was the most expensive item with 45 Euro (ca. 50 USD). Beside the minibar we had also a Nespresso Coffee machine. The wardrobe and drawers were interesting because they hadn't any visible handles. Another interesting feature was the alarm clock. It was cube shaped and completely black, but when pushing the back the time came on digitally, like magic. In room dining is available 24 hours and is catered by Paco Perez incl. dishes from his Casual restaurant. The bathroom was large with separate freestanding bathtub and rain fall shower. The shower head was huge in space, as was the oversized rainshower head. We had two sinks and a separate room for the toilet. The bathroom amenities were by Floris and Gilchrist & Soames. It was the most complete set we've ever seen in a European hotel and included a loofah, lip balm and mouthwash. The bathroom was filled with natural daylight and had it's own blinds and curtains, which were drawn each night at turn down. Turn down included free water from Austria. We had in room dining incl. dinner and breakfast twice. The in room dining menu is similar to The Casual. Paco Perez is a famous Spanish chef and holds 5 Michelin stars. We tried different dishes including Wiener Schnitzel - the only nod to German cuisine -, Gnocci from my friend Zio, Quinoa salad, monkfish and peas \"Catalan Style\" with \"Buttifarra\" and mint and the chocolate bonbons (chocolate flan, Cacao biscuits and coffee ice cream). Needless to say the in room dining was high restaurant quality and served on white linen. I will also write a review of our lunch at Casual. As you can expect from such a high-caliber hotel, our lunch was memorable for the right reasons. We had twice in room breakfast. Once the continental and once the continental plus a hot item each. The continental breakfast included a hot beverage and juice of our choice. We had Cappuccinos, freshly squeezed orange juice, two water, one milk, four bread rolls, different jams, including strawberry, blueberry and apricot by Faller from the Black Forrest and two large organic yogurts by Coop Latteria Vipiteno from Italy - each time a different flavor, like Forrest Berries or strawberry. It was 25 Euro (ca. 27.45 USD) per person. It might seems high priced, but the quality was matching. Our hot items were scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and omelette. We used the shoe shine service as well. It was reliable. Our shoes looked like new after they were returned. On my better half's birthday a cake was delivered to our room. It was delicious and shaped like a flower. The cake included berries, citrus flavors and chocolate - everything he likes. We appricated the gesture and thanked the staff later in the day. There is also a spa, which is reasonable priced. Products used are by Susanne Kaufmann. Massages start from 75 Euro (ca. 82.25 USD) and facials from 85 Euro (ca. 93.20 USD). One of us might give it a try, when staying again at this hotel in our future. The staff was warm and efficient. Switching from English to German and visa verse was not a problem for them. Some of them recognized us and greeted us by name. Our take: The hotel took it's inspiration from the zoo. Some rooms have views over the ostrich enclosure and it is also visible from the beautiful staircase. We liked the luxurious atmosphere, the peaceful location, how detailed Das Stue was, the history, the wonderful food, the contemporary design and the friendliness of the staff. This is a hotel we would gladly return for more beautiful memories. Would we recommend this hotel to a friend? YES! Would we stay again at this hotel in our future? YES!",

      "text": "The views from our room and the hotel's location is outstanding. The proximity to TierGarten and centrum is very convenient.. However, inside the hotel, this just gets better... The whole premise and concept of a 'living room' in which guests are invited to immerse themselves certainly lives up to, and exceeds the expectations that we had. The subtle yet perfect 'Integration' of this amazing building's architectural magnificence and heritage with the best of modern yet understated adaptions is a real aesthetic indulgence. The highly personable and professional staff combined with the uber flow and layout create a real 'laid-back' but still ultra-attentive vibe that is omnipotent throughout. The food, well what can we say, both restaurants were amazing culinary and dining experiences. The bar/cocktail lounge was probably one of best stocked and vibrant that we have experienced in a hotel. The three storey mezzanine library is breathtaking and a cosy and relaxing retreat, so well stocked with Taschen books that it would take a week just to browse through. The spa is an equally wonderful retreat, which is to a standard that you would expect in Northern Europe. We feel that the prices reflect good value for money, particularly relative to establishment of a similar calibre in the UK and in Berlin. We were attracted to stay at Das Stue as its offering appeared to be poles apart from the current local competition, we were not disappointed with our choice. If we had to say one thing, it would be that the eggs at breakfast were inconsistently and poorly cooked, over on scrambled and under on poached. We mentioned this to the staff and this was well received and we were reassured that the matter would be rectified, we have no reason to believe that this won't be the case. We've still given excellent for value for money, as this issue does not detract from the holistic experience and we would be happy to return to Das Stue.",

      "title": "Beautiful luxury Design Hotel in Berlin, we enjoyed our stay, highly recommended",
      "text": "We spent a lot of time on which hotel we should book for our 2night/3days in Berlin, where he was also going to celebrate his birthday. Making up our mind was difficult. We had wittled down our list to two hotels - The Adlon and Das Stue. Should we take a classic hotel, which was similar to the other two hotels we had chosen in Oslo and Stuttgart, these destinations were part of the same itineary, or should we break the mold and check into a design driven hotel? What spoke for The Adlon was the Leading Hotels of the World membership, the location, being in the center of everything, having a wide selection of restaurants including Sra Bua, which we always wanted to try (and still have to in our future), the heritage and the prestige. What spoke against it was the location, the prestige and the value. We were already quite busy in Oslo and Stuttgart. We thought we would overdo it, if we were out and about in Berlin too and it would be more suitable to have a celebratory and quiet birthday. Having experience how overrun some famous hotels, for example The Arts in Barcelona, can be and how even staying guests are treated, we were a bit wary. We also followed the reviews on Trip Advisor. There were indications we might not be able to enjoy our stay to 100 % at the Adlon during this time. Our stay was from a Saturday to Monday. We were comparing rates and found out that The Adlon was available during the week for half the price when booking an entrance category room, so we thought it wasn't worth to spend much more for the same category. Of course we know rates are demand driven and that Berlin is a weekend destination. As a note: Some Berlin hotels up their rates during weekends, while others require a minimum stay of two nights we found out during our research. Das Stue had a slightly higher rate on the Saturday to Sunday than Sunday to Monday. What spoke for Das Stue? We had followed the progress since we heard about the development of the hotel. Das Stue opened in 2012. We liked the contemporary design, unusual concept and playful elements. We also liked the membership. The hotel had joined Design Hotels. Das Stue was our first. Even though the hotel was new the building has a history. It was opened in 1939 as the Royal Danish Embassy. The architect was Johann Emil Schaudt, who was also responsible for the Kaufhaus des Westens (short KaDeWe), Germany's largest and best department store. Later the building was used as a training center for Deutsche Telekom and the Postal Service. When Das Stue, which is Danish and means the living room, was redeveloped as a hotel, different architects were engaged. Axthelm Architekten from Potsdam was responsible for the modern extension. The public spaces were designed by Patricia Urquiola and the rooms by LVG Arquitectura. Patricia Urquiola is Spanish, but lives and works in Milan, while LVG Arquitectura is based in Spain. We also liked the dining concept, which includes two restaurants, Cinco and The Casual, and Das Stue Bar by Paco Perez. The location of Das Stue was also good. On the one side it was in a quiet residential upscale neighborhood and near embassies; on the other side it wasn't too far from the zoo, Kaiser Wilhelm Gedaechtniskirche, the Kudamm and the KaDeWe. We thought Das Stue was a better fit for our needs and had to decide what room type to take. We were considering the Embassy Room or Junior Suite. In the end we thought the Embassy Room was large and if we were able to get a balcony too, which is offered in selected rooms, we would be very happy indeed. We contacted Das Stue via email and advised them about our wishes and the anniversary. Since rooms with balconies are rare, we weren't promised anything. The replies were warm and very quick.

      "text": "Wow, and WOW. This was our first time in Berlin and we chose this hotel as it was the old Danish embassy and, as my BF has Danish ancestry, I thought it would be a fun booking. However, nothing prepared us for such a blisteringly good experience as our 4 day stay at Das Stue. It was only after arriving, we realised it was Berlins number one on Trip Advisor - and its worthy of the title!! The location is terrific, nothing wrong with waking up overlooking Berlin Zoo and its beautiful inmates - in our case, the ostrich and some yaks! Our greeting was exemplary, we were welcomed beautifully, (the reception staff are just fantastic in every way you need them) and, as we were early and our room wasn't quite ready, we enjoyed the first of many perfect cocktails at the beautiful bar. We take many city breaks over UK and Europe, and it is usual for us to stay in a good hotel but venture out for food and drinks throughout our stay. Not so in Berlin. We enjoyed the great city during the day, but felt there was no need to leave this incredible, tranquil oasis at night. You are spoilt with amazing restaurants - we enjoyed The Casual on 3 occasions, enjoying along the way.... black truffle risotto, grouper, great tapas, the best burger you'll ever have, some fine desserts, perfect Rioja - AND attentive, informative and warm, amazing service from the staff - a special mention to terrific Anna and wonderful Lucia. Thank you both for adding to our great stay, you are both delightful. The hotel offers a peaceful and yet lively visit, the bar offers a great atmosphere with its fine music - live on Fridays and Saturdays, but at all other times, a gorgeous selection of perfect-volumed, great jazzy tunes. We were served for the most part by the great and talented Valentino - not only is he charm itself, but he knows his stuff, offering perfect cocktails and drinks with history and knowledge. We consider ourselves to be reasonably qualified with a bar menu (!), but Valentino introduced us to new ideas and has certainly done his homework as his understanding and delivery of the history behind certain drinks and bottles was brilliant. The whole bar staff are impeccably trained to give a great service and welcome to all its customers - so impressive. The general ambience throughout the hotel is perfect. The rooms are super clean, the staff who attend there, offering water late afternoon and asking if anything is required are multi lingual, polite and friendly. The spa is divine, again the staff are on hand but the space is relaxed and welcoming, immaculately clean and well stocked with all you may need for an early swim or a late sauna. The libraries are beautifully appointed, there are various nooks and crannies to enjoy a quiet read or web-surf. I don't smoke, but if I did, I'd enjoy the sexy yurt just outside the bar...covered in animal skin seats and benches and offering a jolly place for the minority to do their thing!! Everything about this place is perfect, it is clean and organised so beautifully but with a calm and serenity that will encourage a relaxed stay. We were told that a new manager is set to take over imminently, I hope he adds to the magic but doesn't hinder any current staff members who run this amazing boutique hotel with grace and sophistication, because they already have a beautiful rhythm. This hotel is the best boutique hotel we've ever stayed in. Beautiful facade, beautiful interior, handy for getting around Berlin, its right on the Tiergarten. I cannot speak too highly of every person in it and everything about it. With just 30 minutes before our cab arrived to return us to the airport, there was time for one last cocktail. The lady who served me was so concerned that her effort would not be up to the standard of Valentino as she had seen him wait on us so often, she commented to my boyfriend that she so hoped it would be ok.........Agnes, you are not only a lovely girl, but you also make a mean Manhatten too - 10/10!! We WILL go back, but next time you are in Berlin, don't bother to research for any other hotel. Das Stue has everything you will ever need and with staff who will ensure your stay is perfect. Love, love, LOVE it!!!",

      "text": "I don't think I have ever found a hotel to be faultless but Das Stue is as near to perfect as it is possible to be. From the beautiful location on the edge of the Tiergarten park and overlooking Berlin zoo to the fabulous staff to the modern d\u00e9cor and perfect cleanliness this is a must recommend hotel and a must return! We stayed in a junior suite overlooking the Tiergarten and were given an excellent introduction to the room by the friendly receptionist who answered lots of our questions about the city and showed us how everything worked. There was also a friendly concierge available to help with questions about the city. Our room was immaculately clean and comfortable and very quiet. The bar area and the library split over three floors are great areas to relax with a drink or snack. The bar staff were friendly and efficient. We didn't dine in the restaurant but can imagine how great it was based on the casual menu and the breakfast. Breakfast was a joy. The staff were superb and the food selection was excellent, fresh and abundant. We particularly enjoyed the beautiful juice and milkshake selection and lovely yoghurts! There was plenty there to suit all tastes and was a very relaxing experience. We used the swimming pool on two occasions which was again immaculately clean and the spa staff seemed very friendly. It was a nice touch to have a selection of flavoured waters and apples available at the pool side. The concierge staff were really helpful with booking taxis and providing us with bikes, and a very special thanks goes to the lady on reception who helped us with a problem we had and needed to phone the airport. She was a fantastic help and really assisted us to make a potentially stressful situation much easier to deal with. Berlin is a fantastic city but Das Stue really made our stay extra special. The only thing I could say is that the technology in the rooms may be quite tricky for some guests as it is top of the range and could take a bit of working out! The location is superb, you can potter round the corner to the zoo. The Brandenburg gate is about 20 minutes away and if you hire bikes you can easily travel all over the city it is very flat and very bike friendly. If you like quality without it being snobby and pretentious then this is the hotel for you. Well done Das Stue we will look forward to returning.",

      "text": "If your idea of a luxury hotel is, the grandeur and splendor of huge magnificent lobbies, gigantic opulent ball rooms, etc.... Then stay in a big chain five star hotel.... If the idea of a luxury establishment is acting a gracious a host as can be..... Then choose a boutique establishment. Boutiques by definition are small, so what they lack in size they can make up in service. The art of \"hosting\" was perfected to a zenith In the \"Das Stue\"! The hotel situated in an upper class quite area in West Berlin, caters to a discerning client, who appreciates subtle nuances in quality individualized service and upper class accommodation. As I arrived by taxi the doorman Rodger opened the door, and welcomed me to the hotel. He took my cases into the hotel, and escorted me to the check-in counter. Check-in was handled by a very professional and courteous Matalina, who the got up to personally show around the hotel, and its facilities. She then showed me to my room, giving me a detailed explanation on all its amenities. I'll go back to describe the hotels features. The architecture of this magnificent building is intricate, intriguing, aristocratic, and it certainly makes you want to see more. The entrance lobby is splendid, built to impress! A stunning chandelier sweep the ceiling of the entire entrance lobby, accompanied by a set of regal staircases, it certainly impresses a new guest who would have just stepped in. The check-in area is nice and cozy. Corridors are truly upper class, with a nice ambience from the lighting. I found the sitting lobby slightly less interesting architecturally, but still nice and cozy. The grand \"library\" lobby, is a curious mix of retro architecture and modern furnishings. I felt I could absolutely connect with the hotels choice of design here. The hotel ensures that you know that it neighbors the zoo, as it has a bunch of quirky animal statues all round the hotel. This adds to the unique atmosphere that the Das Stue has achieved. I stayed in the embassy room. It's not a huge room, but nor is it tiny. The hotel designers have thought about every tiny detail. The room is designed to be modern, fashionable, chic, yet amazingly practical, and with many clever \"mod cons\". Closet open discreetly and intelligent design hide openings seamlessly. The electronic pad for the key is practical and different. Lighting is just wonderful, discreet, and adjustable in accordance with your mood. The light switches are a cool new generation designed electronic touch panel. The panel also controlled the shutters electronically. The bathroom has a clever \"removable wall\". This means you can have the bath open to the room, or by moving the wall it's enclosed as a separate unit. A stand alone quality rain shower was situated between the toilet and bath. Toiletries supplied were of excellent quality. Many different toiletries were given, including the basic shower gels, shampoo etc....mouth wash, lip balm, shoe shine, and much more. They even supplied a quality long handled wooden shoe horn, clothes brush, and a umbrella! Robes and slippers were also supplied. There was no iron or trouser press in the room. A trouser press would have suited this great establishment. The bed was super comfortable with quality linens and pillows. Three chairs were in the room, here the quirky design was at the expense of their comfort. But the design certainly added to the atmosphere that the room had. A well stocked mini-bar was available, as well as a Apple Mac. Tv selection was ok, but it's English selection was poor. No on demand movies were available, how ever Internet access was given on the Mac. Wifi is free and works very well in the entire hotel. The room sported a cool view to the ostriches and wallabies in the zoo. The nice thing about housekeeping was that they did the room twice a day. In the morning they cleaned up, changed towels etc, and place decorative pillows and bedspreads on the bed. In the afternoon they cleaned up, and prepared the room for night. Replacing decorative pillows with practical ones for sleep, closing shutters and curtains etc. This was a really nice touch that you seldom get from hotels. All staff were absolute excellent. I must say that I never experienced such good service anywhere else, and I've done my fair share of hotel hopping! The bar has a large selection, but is very expensive. The spa is truly boutique sporting a sauna and small swimming pool. I believe that if I could give one piece of advice to Das stue, I would tell them to recreate the pool to a warm hydrotherapy pool. With massage jets, etc. The do have two \"jacuzzi\" outlets in the end of the pool. But the water is cold, so there is little pleasure sitting in cold bubbles. I did not eat in the hotel, so I cannot comment of the food. Check out was as good as check-in handled by the wonderful Merve. All in all..... A unique hotel, which has thought of absolutely everything. Service is second to none, and its design was created with luxury and practicality in mind. I would certainly recommend this establishment to all boutique hotel lovers..... It may well be the best boutique you will ever stay in! Thank you Das Stue, Matalina, Merve, and Rodger.",

      "text": "Let me start of by saying that I have stayed in various hotels throughout Berlin and have found this one to be both the most comfortable and service friendly hotel in all the years I have visited this city. Let us take a look at the categories in order, such that it can allow me to rate this hotel in a more detailed manner. Type of Visit: My type of visit was on business and I stayed in this hotel to find a relaxing place to withdraw from work. Thus it overall gave me all of the comfort I needed intended for business traveling. There is free wireless in each room and a very modern high standard flat screen TV with an Apple Touch Pad for navigation. They encompass a wide variety of programmes from Sky to all of the important new channels of different countries such as American, British, Russian and Arabian news stations. There is a modern AC built into the room that is accurately variable. Rooms: As described below I stayed in a room on the top floor with a grandeur view on the centre of Berlin. The windows are wide from floor to ceiling and give an overview of the Tierpark, with the occasional Ostrich strolling around below. In the horizon Mercedes and Bayer can be seen and there is a fantastic city lighting at night. The rooms contain Box Spring Double Bed mattresses that ensured a thorough sleep and had warm and comfortable pillows and bed covers. The bath is amazingly modern with a high-tech sink and LED lighting. The shower is excellent and provides a fantastic shower experience with view on the room and south side of the Tierpark. The wireless internet functioned perfectly and there was consistent room service each time I came back. Cleanliness: I encountered the very stylish lobby, caf\u00e9 and rooms to be spotlessly neat and tidy. The bathrooms and even the Spa and Workout Room were very clean. My congrats to the service on that matter. Location: The location is perfect for both open transport, cars and cycling. There is a possibility to reach all major inter city stations and most locations are easily accessible. Another nice thing about the location is the fact that it provides a very good access to the Tiergarten, both park and zoo and it allows a nice stroll through a bit of nature. Breakfast and Caf\u00e9: The breakfast ha a wide variety of menus available and is an excellent way to start the morning. Although a little expensive at times, the caf\u00e9 can be very relaxing in the evenings. Summary: I can conclude that this hotel was a grandeur experience to stay in and I would come back to book a room here anytime again when I visit Berlin.",

      "text": "I liked the suite. Spacious area, amazing sunlight and nice bathtub. I was getting water for a nice bath and realized the water just purely YELLOW. There is nothing they could do about that at the moment, so I decided to just let that go and didn't take a bath. Later, I told one of the staffs, and all I got was \"Oh!\" I didn't want to ruin my trip in beautiful Berlin, so I let that go. (And I sent a brand new white knit dress to dry clean) Due to some other unsatisfying room conditions, I got a different room. When I packed my stuff, I forgot and left my face wash and tax refund forms on the table. After moving to a different room and many hours later, I realized I had left my stuff in the other room. I called the front desk and told the situation. Front desk said they will call back in a bit and when they called, \"our housekeepers are not here anymore.\" WHAT? Are you kidding me? It didn't make sense but I yet again was calm and said then let them know when they come in tomorrow. Same night, I receive my dress I had sent in for dry cleaning. None of the stains were gone (which is fine then I can just resend them), but the front part of the dress was completely nappy, and there was a tiny note saying \"We couldn't remove the stains and further cleaning would damage the garment.\" At this point I couldn't hold myself. I called the front desk and told them about the dress, and the answer was we will send someone up and have a look at it. Someone comes up and he goes \"Excuse me, madam. I'm just a bell boy and the front desk told me to just come up here.\" I can't even write anymore because I'm losing myself getting reminded about this. The results: 1. They lost my face wash and tax refund forms (words of the front desk lady - \"The housekeepers probably have cleaned them out.\") 2. Dry cleaners through the hotel completely ruined my new dress (They said they would pay me back for the amount of the dress, but it's been a month and I still haven't received it) 3. NO FORMAL APOLOGIES AT ALL 4. (I doubt they even fixed the rusty water) These things will never likely to happen to most travelers, but I think the hotel needs to train their employees more about better customer services and how to handle things. I would have not rated at all for this terrible experience but the lobby and libraries were beautiful, and since I'm generous, so I'll give \"POOR.\"",

      "title": "Great Location with Great Leisure Facilities on a Great Bus Route",
      "text": "I stayed with my fellow travelling friends in the Pullman Berlin Schweizerhof on a Leisure and culture break of Berlin for 3 nites. The hotel did not seem busy and the staff were attentive, well presented and pleasant with very good English. The location of the hotel is situated excellently considering the size of the city where everything is not together \u2013 IE \u2013 the city is very large with no real centre and thus spread out; So one needs to be on a bus route! This hotel is on a great bus route if not the best bus line and the 200 route goes outside the hotel and basically links west Berlin where the hotel is situated to east Berlin (old town). In fact the no. 200 bus goes the same way as the tour bus (in part). They also go every 10 mins and cost 2.50euro EW. They are safe and clean. The concierge in the hotel can organise tickets which you have to validate on the bus (although we did not realise this and effectively used it again the second nite). The location is opposite the Berlin Zoo and the beginning of the shopping area - Kurf\u00fcrstendamm . There is a great department store \u2013 \u201cKaDeWe\u201d where they serve excellent food in various small boutique restaurants on the top floor whilst providing all the usual top international designers brands on the other 6 floor and refined palates will find it hard to choose from the some 33,000 delicacies from all corners of the world. Other good locations for Lunch would be the inspiring Italian Chain (german owned) called Vapiano which are located off the Ku-damn or around the corner from the Ritz Carlton which is located in the area between this hotel and the old town (east berlin) in an area know as Potsdamer Platz. However, back to the Pullman Berlin Schweizerhof which is the subject of this review. Now, the best thing about this hotel is the Leisure Centre with Spa facilities including showers and thermal treatments all of which are free. There is a full menu of massage and treatments which appear very reasonably priced. The pool is effectively the highlight of the hotel as its a great size with a luxury setting transposed with mood lighting and relaxing seating circumventing the pool. Assistance around the pool again like the lobby is excellent and professional which is courtesy of Mr. Butlins who was our leisure assistant for most of the evenings that we visited him. There is a discreet lift down to the pool area from the room which is excellent as it allows for one to use the complimentary robe and slippers from the room. The rooms themselves are well equipped (flat screen TV with in house movies and satellite channels), Internet access and minibar safe) and laid out. The only fault (if sharing) they are a little on the small side but the corridor area will always make up for this. The air conditioning is a little poor but might have been to do with the fact that we couldn't work it or two large lads in one rooms. There is a small little bar in the lobby that is smart and good place to end the nite after being to the Matrix or one of the other great nite spots in Berlin. There is a restaurant in the hotel which looks good but I cant comment on it, as we did not eat there - nothing to do with the hotel but merely because it better to go out and about. We went to the old town (Alexander Platz / TV tower area or overall the Mite area) in an area called the Nikolai quarter . This is the very core of old Berlin or, strictly speaking, of the eastern half of C\u00f6lln-Berlin, on the site of the oldest known settlement on a ford around the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas' Church). The Nikolaiviertel as its locally known as presents a stark contrast to the open spaces on its northern side between the Palace of the Republic and the Television Tower and contains great little restaurants, coffee shops and bars. However, its not the \u201ctemple bar\u201d area in Dublin but starkly different with an emphasis more on romantics\u2019 given its location along the River Spree. There is a fantastic French restaurant facing the river spree between a bar called Brauhaus Georgebrou and the next bridge up toward Ephraims coffee shop(about 50m) I would recommend the French onion soup and fantastic meat dishes with great collection of good French reds. So to sum up, a great city with some great sights with no better base to explore from than the Pullman Berlin Schweizerhof. Enjoy or as they say in Berlin - Hab Spa\u00df! (JD)",

      "title": "A Short Summer Break In Berlin",
      "text": "My family stayed in Berlin 18/8/05 to 22/8/05 flying there from Budapest returning to Newcastle taking advantage of Easyjet's ridiculously low prices. We stayed close to the Zoo and Kurfustendamm Street area in the superb Dorint Sofitel Hotel Schweizerhof and found it to be a excellant hub to visit all of Berlin being as it was close to several rail stations. It also had the advantage of being near the Tourist Information centre in the Europa Centre which although always busy was useful for buying half price theatre tickets on the day of the performance. We went to see the Blue MAN Group having previously seen them in Chicago and apart from missing out on some of the jokes written in German on placards and projections we really enjoyed the night out. This area is also very good for eating out we particularly enjoyed a typically German meal at arestaurant called ZUR KNEIPE on Rankestrasse off Kurfurstendamm where I had a massive meal called a Butchers Platter comprising of boiled pork and three different sorts of sausage with potatoes and sauerkraut. This restaurant seemed to be a bit of a rarity most restaurants being more international such as the Avanti Italian restaurant where we also dined. Just up from our Hotel on Budapeststrasse was a cheap restaurant called ROMIOSINI which did a mixture of international dishes at very low prices ie mixed grill 6.8 euros,pizza 2.8 e and souvlaki 4.75 e. We visited all the well known sites including Checkpoint Charlie which costs 5.5 euros for students and 9.5 e for adults. Most of the displays had English subtitles and were very interesting. Also worth visiting is the Topography Of Terror exhibitions based adjacent to an area which formed the cellars of Prince Albert Strasse where the Nazi headquarters were based. Here all for free you are supplied with headphones from which you are told the harrowing history of the now demolished buildings. A must to do is to visit the site of the former concentration camp at Sachsenhausen this is only an hours train ride from Berlin and for a family ticket on the train cost only 14.8 euros. From the train station it is about a twenty minute walk or you could catch a bus there seemed to be two an hour. The site itself is free and everyone should ensure they visit in order to appreciate that regimes such as the Nazis must never rise again. After you will need a stiff drink from one of the bars on the walk back. Finally a small word about transport round Berlin tickets can be bought from machines (there is an English translation) and for less than 15 euros a family and up to three children can travel round Berlin all day. The trains are very frequent though often busy. Berlin is a hotch potch of architectural styles from the totally avant garde to the Totalitarian drabness of the former communist bloc but all in all it should be visited. Just a word of warning to the more sensitive be careful in the parks it seems the city male population think nothing of just abandoning all their clothes and lying in full view in parks such as the Tiergarten.",

      "title": "Not up to Sofitel standards",
      "text": "We arrived at the hotel at 7pm and strangely enough there was no porter available to help us with the luggage. Check in was quick and effortless and we were assigned room 553. The room was small and not what we had booked. The requested room was \u201cgarden view\u201d away from the heavy traffic outside the hotel. This room was facing the street and it was HOT, not just warm but VERY HOT. The air-conditioning is not that but rather a ventilation system which did not cool the room down, opening the windows meant that the system switched off and of course the street noise became unbearable. As a Sofitel Privilege customer (their loyalty card scheme) the room did feature a welcome platter of fruit and some mineral water. What it did not have was the requested double bed; instead it had two single beds pushed together with uncomfortable mattresses and tiny duvets. Not all the Sofitel international standard, where was the MyBed (Sofitel\u2019s incredibly comfortable bed)? Not willing to accept this for \u20ac145/night I changed room to across the hall but was reminded by the staff that the room standard for the category booked. Well I don\u2019t agree with that and I found this an inherent problem with German Sofitels. They are not up to the international standards. The new room (554) at least had a double bed (but alas still two tiny duvets) and of course the bed was incredibly uncomfortable (same old mattress). But at least it was quiet. Positives about the hotel are: the staff (very courteous at all levels), the food (breakfast was excellent and so was dinner in the restaurant) and location. Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don\u2019t stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room). This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.",

      "text": "This was a special occasion visit to Berlin, and so, I had carried out a substantial amount of research and comparison before booking. In the end, I felt as if I had made the correct choice but a little doubt remained as this was our first visit to the city. On arrival, any lingering concern was immediately dispelled. From check-in until departure, the staff were professional, efficient, helpful and friendly. Staff competence in speaking English ranged from satisfactory to excellent - any point in this range being way beyond my almost non-existent German (although my mangled efforts seemed to be appreciated - I think!). I had opted for the 'Superior' room (which is the smallest accomodation available) and was very pleased with my choice. Like the rest of the hotel, it was clean, contemporary and air-conditioned (as required). Toiletries and bath/shower robes were provided - the latter could be used to visit the pool, sauna et al (via a lift separate from the main public ones). Coffee/tea and bottled water were available free of charge. In addition, the room contained a safe and a mini-bar. Not that we watched much beyond a little BBC News but a number of UK TV channels was available on the room's good-sized flat-screen TV. A wide range of facilities was available including: a swimming pool, a sauna, a small gym, bike hire (Berlin is very flat and pavements have designated cycle lanes), a laundry service, a restaurant along with a smaller snack/light meals/bar area, and a concierge service. Other facilities are shown on the hotel website. We liked the location of the hotel. As well as being around only about ten minutes from the shops of Kurfurstendamm and Tauentzienstrasse (the latter contains Berlin's largest store, Ka DeWe), it is a fifteen to twenty minute walk to/from the Zoologischer Garten ('Zoo Station') - a major travel hub - through which U-bahn, S-bahn and regional trains travel (the latter (RE7/RB14) will take you to/from Schoenfeld Airport). Bus service 200 will transport you from the bus terminus immediately outside 'Zoo Station' to a bus stop about 150 metres from the hotel in little over five minutes. From this same bus stop, bus service 200 goes in to the centre of Berlin every ten minutes. Unsurprisingly, this will bring you back. Alternatively, bus service 100 will bring you to Kurfurtenstrasse (the main street behind the hotel). In addition, the Wittenbergplatz U-bahn station is a ten-minute walk from the hotel where a train will take you in to the centre of Berlin. Finally, I should say that my hotel default position is the smaller family-run hotel (rather than a large hotel, such as, the Schweizerhof, which is part of a chain) but I was pleasantly surprised, and ultimately, very impressed - and that's from someone who's not easily impressed. If I was to return to Berlin at any point in the foreseeable future, I would not contemplate any further hotel research but would unhesitatingly book a room at the Pullman Schweizerhof.",

      "text": "Let me start by saying I would have given this hotel 5 stars, however, the fees for phone calls were outrageous...very difficult if you are an american, needing to call home to US..that said...let me move on to the review: The hotel is in a good location...not a far walk at all to the subway zoo station, or the Kudam station...Berlin is a cool city, very clean...the hotel is close to a money exchange store, at the \"Euro Center\" which is a very large indoor \"mall\" area...close to some nice restaurants, especially Italian restaurants, some neat little bars..overall we thought the prices in the area were good, especially for wines...most everyone spoke english...there are several nice stores, and you are maybe two streets fromt the Kudam, which is a street with restaurants and stores... The Hotel: not on a overally busy street. Very modern look to it...nicely decorated...impressive actually, front desk staff very nice...the rooms are a bit smallish, but not bad...very clean and modern looking...flat screen TV that you can program for english...it has a speaker in the bathroom as well...our room had no bureau!, but my brother's room did...he was a single, and we were two people with a lot of clothes, and one small closet for them, and a couple of shelf areas...I loved the tea/coffee drawer...HINT: you must pull the drawer all the way out, for the teapot to turn on...electric kettle...was a nice touch...there is a mini bar, but it was way over-priced...we simply removed some items, but put our own wine, milk and snacks in it, and no one ever said anything to us...the bathroom was roomy, however the blowdryer was terrible, bring your own/with adapter...There was a charge for internet use, seemed high, so we didn't use it, but the room had a desk that was equipped for it. The shower was great, always hot water, weird shower door, but it worked. They give you slippers/bathrobe, which we discovered is what they want you to use in the wellness area...we used the bathrobe, and our flip flops... Maid Service: outstanding...we tipped the maid third day we were there, as she did a great job..I left her messages in German for extra sugar, tea bags, and was always accomodated...the linens were very crisp and clean...the beds were fine...the pillows are okay, kind of mushy...I must mention the light situation, as no one at desk mentioned how to keep lights on, I just knew from reading it on trip advisor's forum from Mexico...you must keep one of your room keys in the slot by the door at all times while in the room to keep the lights on...very quiet room...never heard a peep in hallway etc...as others have mentioned, the rooms get too warm...and we were there end of Feb/beginning of March...we needed the A/C on, and the thermostat in the room only went just so far..we needed to keep window opened but it was kind of damp and nasty weather a few nights, so that wasn't good...we told front desk and they said they would adjust it, didn't seem to make too much difference, so when we left, we would leave both windows open to let some air in...also the beds don't have sheets..there is a bottom sheet but no sheet to cover you, you are supposed to use the feather bed to cover you, but it was so stuffy in room that this was way too hot, so we would remove the feather bed from the cover, and use the cover as a sheet...these were just some things we had to get used to, I haven't been to europe in a long time, and I guess I'm \"americanized\" so it was an adjustment...but I really liked the room, and just loved the tea kettle set up...overall impression of room/hallways/hotel is really nice pretty modern looking hotel...great little bar area...the happy hour is from 9PM to 10PM, and you can get some good prices on cosmos there, which were very good...we did not eat at the hotel, it seemed pretty pricey...breakfast was inclulded with our rate, and it was the best breakfast I've ever been to in any hotel...they had everything you could think of...including a station that made crepes, omelettes etc...a nice juice set up...and the rolls were to die for...best rolls I've ever had...if you can get that included in your rate, what a bargain, as its pretty expensive to pay for separate... The subway: very user friendly system, color coded, maps are avail at the little stores inside the stations, they have the ones with the larger print...easy to read, easy to use, no problems, and pretty clean...we purchased a pass for the week, and it included unlimited subway, train, bus use...which worked for us, as my brother's apt was outside Berlin city... Wellness Centre: Very nicely done..beautiful indoor pool, supposedly 82 F, but I will tell you when you first dip in, it seems kind of cold...you adjust pretty quickly, but I would like to have seen it much warmer..there is no hot tub so that could be disappointing for some...there is a great steam room, best I've ever used..it has a eucylptus infusion in it, which when first entered it is overpowering, but give it a chance, it was fantastic..my brother/sister had colds, and they said it was great for clearing their system...there are two rain showers then to wash off in, which were nice and toasty...we saw the ice, wasn't interested in it...and the foot spas, we didn't use those either...now if you go directly into pool after steam room, you will freeze going into that pool water...you will get used to it, but I really think they should up the temperature...we asked, and were told they couldn't...but nonetheless, the pool is pretty, and once you adjust to the temp, its quite nice to float, or swim in...the loungers at the pool were the most comfortable loungers ever, we fell asleep on them...its a very relaxing area...there is a cool upstairs area as well where you can read...and access an outdoor deck that was pretty, no chairs, but it was winter...The wellness area is so pretty and relaxing that the pool water really didn't matter too much in the end, as we used it everyday and enjoyed every bit of it... The lobby has a bowl of granny smith apples that you can take...so our overall impression of the hotel was I would stay there again, now that I am aware of the phone thing...which was really a headache for the first few days...our cells did not work, and the only way to reasonably call the US for us, was to walk to a \"phone store\" and use the phones in there, that was cheap...we bought a phone card, and at the end of our stay the hotel charged us 3.50 euro each time we used it from the room...I wish the hotel had told us that beforehand, as I asked them about the phone store to begin with.. that was a shocker to the tune of roughly 350.00 US dollars tacked onto our bill...we are trying to talk to hotel about that now, if they credit us some of that back then my rating would go up to 5 stars...I think that is way overpriced to charge tourists...Overall great modern pretty hotel, great area...fantastic wellness area....great stay...",

The highlights of the hotel from our point of view are: 1/ SLEEPING AMENITIES: mattresses, pillows, blankets, linen - just everything in the bed is so relaxing that you have to make an effort or even two or three to get out of it. 2/ BREAKFASTS: we have visited a few restaurants serving very good breakfasts but this one is one of the best-best. I can\u2019t point any terrible shortcomings that spoilt our stay, but there were some disappointments taking into account 200 Euros per night: - I expected our Family Deluxe room to be spacious as it was announced on Accor website where we booked the hotel \u2013 the only place for kid\u2019s bed was in front of our bed and it left little space on the way - in our opinion the room was not spacious enough for a Deluxe Family status, - I expected our Family room bed to be a Family bed which, in my opinion, is a double bed with one mattress but not two separate mattresses so we had no family bed, - There were no marks about our late check out at reception although it was part of our package (Business offer), I had to ask and remind about it, - Other reviews mentioning odd (to say the least) naked men sitting with all their treasures out at the spa zone are true \u2013 the hotel MUST do something about the rules for this place obvious to all clients \u2013 we could NOT use the spa together as a family. It is not a nudist party \u2013 it is a European top class hotel with child friendly policy. Is it not?!",

      "title": "a nice experience but nothing extraordinary",
      "text": "Steigenberger Hotel Berlin have seen better days. It could be an excellent 4star hotel, but the 5 star rating is little too much already. The location is really convenient, you're a bus ride away to Tegel airport, the U1 line is just behind the block as well as the stop of the famous 100 and 200 buses. The area is full of shops and places to dine in and it is located on the main shopping and commercial district of Berlin. The hotel itself has nothing really particular to look for, the lobby has very minimal and lousy old furnitures. The receptionists ( i met 3 of them during my stay ) are very limited to check-in and check-out processes, and to say \"yes\" or \"no\" on questions. I would've preferred them more welcoming. At check-in, no one has ever mentioned where to do breakfast, where and what is offered on the spa and what other facilities are available. They just ask who you are, your credit card and they would hand your key already, they would not even mention where to go for the elevator (which is not hard to figure, but still..) . Everything is written, but i personally think that at check-in the receptionists could take a minute or two and explain stuffs about the hotel itself and probably the surrounding area because it would somehow make their guests feel more welcomed and appreciated. The room is spacious enough, with proper sitting area, personalized welcome message on the tv (yeah, it's the little detail that counts), clean enough but you could feel the years it had already. In our bathroom, we are missing the lower panel that covers the bathtub so you could see under with the pipes and cemented area without flooring, it's not a problem at all, but it definitely gives you the feeling of a crumbling place. Breakfast is good and with various options available, fresh cheese collection and special dishes like smoked salmon and fresh honey. I just noticed that during my two-days stay, it would take you a while or sometimes you have to really go and ask the waitresses to serve you coffee, unless you're in a suit and tie. I don't know if its relevant but i seemed to notice that, being the place always full of businessmen doing conventions, they tend to attend to them even before they could take their sit while i had to go and ask for my coffee after waiting sometime. They do not have the Executive lounge anymore. It was that extra touch I was looking forward to, but no, it seems to be replaced by the fitness lounge which I didn't even care to check since Im not visiting Berlin to spend the first hours of my day on a \"tapis roulant\". Room service was excellent, their housekeepers would attend to every need you have, checking even during late afternoon if you need anything. If you're not in the room, they would even prepare your bed for sleeping. Unfortunately, none of them speaks a word in english. Bottomline is, it was a nice stay, a nice place and a nice location. If i would search some comfortable place to stay in Berlin, I'd probably stay here again. If I'm searching for the real 5 star feel, I'd definitely go and search elsewhere. P.s. They made me pay 6bucks for the bottle of water we had when we should have it free being in the executive floor but since i had my flight to catch I didn't argue nor ask. But others could better check on it.",

Being close to Zoo station also means that it's very simple to get to and from Berlin Tegel airport. I'm usually not the one to select hotel based on the number of stars, but rather by location and reviews made by other guests. I need walls, floor, roof, a bed, wifi and a bathroom to be satisfied (although I've added \"a real door\" to that list since staying at a hotel that was a bit too run-down even for my taste). Other than that, four- or five star hotels usually offer me nothing that I find useful, but the Steigenberger offered great value for just a little extra money. The hotel staff was quite friendly and professional. The room was nice, clean, spacious and comfortable. The mini bar had a decent selection of beverages and got restocked each day, as well as an espresso machine with complimentary coffee. The interior decoration was top notch, with a comfortable bed, a large flat-screen TV, a small seating area, and a desk to set up my laptop. The hotel piano bar had a nice nice and relaxing atmosphere, although I only stayed long enough to have a beer and some snacks before going off to bed on my first night. Oh, being able to check-out as late as 3pm was great as well. However, there are a few things that could be improved a bit. - My room had a safety box, but it was a bit too small. Passport, money, my extra cellphone and one of my camera lenses would fit inside, but my - ultraportable-notepad-sized - laptop would not. - Breakfast wasn't included and costs a whopping 23\u20ac, so I decided to have breakfast at the hotel only on my last day in Berlin. When I entered the salon - after signing a bill in advance - there weren't a single seat available. Not much of a problem though. I just had the bill torn, but it meant taking some time to find something to eat elsewhere when I had planned to eat and then go straight to the Helmut Newton museum. - I planned on working out (with weights) one night, but the hotel fitness centre only offers a few threadmills, crosstrainers and an espresso machine. Not exactly what I was looking for after spending a whole day walking across Tiergarten, climbing to the top of the Victory column and stopping by local coffee shops numerous times. - The water pressure in the shower was a bit weak, meaning that it took a lot longer to shower than I'm used to. The water fixture was a bit loose also, but it didn't break of during my stay. And the water temperature constantly jumped between \"steam\" and \"ice cubes\". All in all, these faults weren't much of a problem to me, and I consider the stay at the Steigenberger great value for my money. I might very well stay there again the next time I visit Berlin.",

      "text": "This was our 80th hotel stay, on an extended around-the-world trip, and our second Berlin hotel. We stayed four nights in a standard (twin) room, at an average of US/AUD$120/night (approx EUR95/night) booked via hotels.com a few days prior to our stay. Overall we found the Berlin hotel market had lots of choice at great value. We selected this hotel because we wanted to extend our stay in Berlin, and our previous hotel (Concorde) was unfortunately fully booked. This hotel was the closest reasonable alternative. Overall, this was one of the most annoying hotel stays we\u2019ve had across 23 countries and in eleven months of travel. It\u2019s an older hotel wth a large number of rooms, recently refurbished and with staff a little rushed. The service level, comfort and attention expected from a five star hotel wasn\u2019t there. What\u2019s good: The area is central to modern shops, lots of restaurants and cafes, several subway stations and is conveniently located for lots of tourist activities (Zoo, Berlin Museum, Tiergarten Park). This area felt safer than around Alexanderplatz. It\u2019s a large hotel with lots of rooms \u2013 so expect a long walk from some rooms (>100m) to hotel lifts. Our room (#469) was average to smallish size, small bathroom, and refurbished with modern colours and fittings. There\u2019s a mini-fridge and tea/coffee making facilities in the room (though herbal teas only \u2013 no black tea). Bedding was very comfortable. Window able to be slightly opened for fresh air. Annoyances: Lots of door slamming (there\u2019s no door/lock dampening) and loud guest hallway noise, paticularly in the early hours of weekends. I\u2019m not a review extremist (you know the ones that write \u2018we saw a bug and the whole stay was appalling\u2019 or equally as bad: \u2018we loved the wallpaper colour so the whole stay was amazing\u2019), and a few small issues generally don\u2019t bother us but we had lots of minor issues that stacked up here. Annoyances: Whilst we were early for check-in (11:30am), we were unable to be accommodated at the time of our arrival. Most hotels have a pm check-in however there\u2019s not many where we haven\u2019t been able to check in a little earlier. We were able to leave our luggage in locked storage however. On check-in, reception assumed that two women travelling together couldn\u2019t possibly want the double bed they booked, so have this twin bed room instead. And whilst we could have requested a room change, we\u2019d just moved from another Berlin hotel that morning, and didn\u2019t feel like moving again. So the twin room it was. Reception did apologise when the issue was raised with them later. We had the swipe card for our room issued three times. After staying at over 80 hotels worldwide, we\u2019re fairly comfortable with these. Sometimes they don\u2019t always work on first swipe, but try several times \u2013 faster, slower, swipe the right direction, hold your mouth a different way, and inevitably it does. It didn\u2019t so back to reception who checked the card and said it was fine and must be operator error. Back up to the room and try again. Fail. Back to reception for a different receptionist to check the card again, and tell me there\u2019s a fault with the card. So with the second-issued card, we can now enter the room. Once one card has been reissued however, any earlier-issued secondary cards are voided. So back down to reception to have the secondary card validated for the second time. Each time, an approximate 100 metre walk to the lifts, and another 100 metres back, and a queue at reception to wait for service. Luckily we like walking. Later that day we have card fail for the third time, and the housekeeper tells us she\u2019s had problems entering our room. It\u2019s obvious there\u2019s a fault with the reader mechanism on the door. Similarly there\u2019s a fault with the locking mechanism on the window in our room. We attempt to find a particular brand of camera dealer locally and turn to the hotel for assistance \u2013 we want a store that can issue tax refund forms, allowing us to claim the VAT on our purchase on leaving the EU. After waiting over 10 minutes at concierge for no service, and then queueing again, reception refer us to a small desk behind the reception area. Despite explaining our requirement several times, the attendant gives verbal directions for two large department stores in the area, in a \u2018can\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy\u2019 kind of way. And despite asking to be shown the directions on a map, we were dismissed with a bit of hand waving while she answered the phone. We gave up in frustration, found one department store, and lost out on being able to claim the EUR70 VAT paid on the purchase. The number one rule for housekeeping is usually \u2018don\u2019t throw out things that aren\u2019t in the bin\u2019. Unfortunately this rule didn\u2019t apply here and whilst it was only a minor issue in housekeeping assuming ziplock bags tucked behind our toiletries were rubbish, it\u2019s still annoying having to replace something that was not in the bin and should have been left untouched. On check-out, we were erroneously charged for breakfast one morning when we\u2019d had none. On requesting to see the charge voucher to verify the signature on it was not ours, we were informed there\u2019s no signing for room charges. Whilst the charge was reversed without problems, it was just one more hassle to deal with. Staff were polite and spoke reasonable english however there was a rushed efficiency in all our dealings with them. The free wifi was slow with a weak signal, and constantly dropped out. Coupled with having to re-enter an access code after a few minutes of inactivity made it almost unusuable. Whilst shower water pressure was good, the temperature fluctuated every few minutes between scalding and cool. If you read the hotel compendium, you\u2019ll note there\u2019s a free bottle of water provided daily. The hotel could perhaps clarify or direct guests to which bottle of water in the room (or mini-fridge) that is. So whilst there was nothing majorly terrible about our stay, the combination of the noise and a continual chain of annoying events led us to have a rather frustrating stay. The hotel feels like mutton dressed as lamb, and we felt it didn\u2019t provide anywhere near the service you\u2019d expect from a one purporting to be five star. We felt quite invisible as guests and wouldn\u2019t return.",

      "text": "I came home (NYC) 4 days ago after spending 16 days at the Steigenberger, while in Berlin on vacation. I have visited Berlin 22-23 times since 1990 (and once in 1980), all on vacation. I have stayed at perhaps 10 hotels, but once I discovered the Steigenberger, I never left it. I must have been there the last 10 or more visits. Its location is perfect for me: one block from the heart of commercial western Berlin (KaDeWe, for example), and the subway system, with the S-Bahn (longer distance city and suburban trains, including Potsdam) only a bit farther away at the Zoologischer Bahnhof. Yet the hotel sits on a large park, facing a residential section of the city, with no real towers in sight. A room on the top floor, front, is well worth it; although I have been happy with all the rooms I have had there. (The hotel is only 6 stories tall; so the views allow you to still feel part of the city, which I like, as opposed to looking down at it from a tower.) The staff are all friendly and seem genuinely anxious to provide whatever information or help you need. Reception and dining staff personnel, in my experience, all speak fluent English; and the room staff's English is completely sufficient. Breakfasts at the Steigenberger are unique in my experience: an unlimited buffet in a large, bright room overlooking the park, with food that is constantly kept fresh. The choice is endless, although being from the U.S. I have to mention that they have the best scrambled eggs......always hot........that I have ever eaten. However I also have long liked to start off with cold ham, cheese, and thin slices of cucumber.....or maybe have both. And there is everything else one associates with breakfast. I would say to try the orange marmalade which I think is excellent, and their pastries and fruit salad. I have also eaten dinner in the \"Stube\" and in the main dining room, always with excellent food and service. And do try the afternoon coffee and cake in the bar. I'd suggest the strawberry cake, tho' I'm sure they're all good. I have used the laundry service, which is fast and very well done. Also the wifi is fine, even in the room (I say \"free\" below: that may depend on the room cost.) Rooms are made up quickly each morning, usually while I'm at breakfast; or if you prefer to sleep late and not be disturbed, or take an afternoon nap, you will NOT be bothered. Even though the Steigenberger is of course part of a hotel group, I feel I am at a unique place, one of a kind. It is large enough, but not at all a huge \"chain\" hotel in feeling. Although there were some business meetings there, they were in their area......not mine. It feels geared to individual travellers, and to service and quality. I have checked \"yes\" below for \"charming\". This is not a small boutique hotel by any means with whatever that implies; but with its staff's friendliness especially, and with its location and food, I could not have answered \"no\". I love exploring Berlin which is fascinating, wonderful, and huge.......sometimes on foot (7 miles one day), sometimes further with the transport system. And the whole experience is even more gratifying when I turn the corner at the end of my daily travels and see the cream colored Steigenberger down the block or across the park (Los Angeles Platz). As I told one of the Reception Desk staff: \"Hier fuhle Ich mich zu Hause.\" (I feel at home here.)",

      "title": "The patronizing receptionist......",
      "text": "Visited Steigenberger for our first time in Berlin. Despite what the guy at the desk said we definitely booked breakfast as part of the deal; the computer did not indicate that we had done, but it was definitely the website that was at fault; our booking was not processed properly. The staff was not attentive at all and the man at reception could not conceive how much of a problem it was that we now were not going to get breakfast, in fact the desk guy just seemed patronizing towards my girlfriend and spoke to her like a child that didn't get a sweet, even though she is 29 with two degrees and doesn't work behind a desk in a hotel. He said that we can pay \"just\" 23 euros per person a day for breakfast. Frankly, I had to get away from him because I was beginning to lose control. The fact that another two people at reception who had just served a customer before us decided to feign obliviousness to our existence did not help ease my temper. Actually we were ignored a few times at reception. Another thing I'd like to mention is this; putting a \"clean my room\" sign on my door means I want them to clean my room and placing a do not disturb sign on my room door means do not disturb, right? So in what world does putting no sign on the door mean burst in whilst my girlfriend and I are both in bed to clean my room? Some of the staff there really tested my patience and were unpleasant. It seems to me that from the moment we arrived we were treated a particular way, perhaps because of how we look, maybe we didn't appear wealthy enough; we spent a good deal of money on the mini bar and meals etc, so what other poor excuse do they have? I'd argue that this place should not be a five star hotel rating because of the lack of customer service attentiveness. When we arrived the man at the main door did not offer to take our cases even though he had an empty trolley. They seemed to change towels, they made the bed and generally tidied the room, which is why I gave a 2 out of 5 score. However, a three star has staff make the bed, change towels and generally clean the room so what did we pay for? The staff weren't helpful with the breakfast issue we had and ignored us twice at reception so once again, why the five star rating? Having said this, just before we left we had a few drinks in the piano lounge and the guy that worked there was a nice fellow and deserves a few good words said about him. He was warm and friendly and seemed to go that little bit further in his customer service; I wish I knew his name so that no one else gets his praise for being good at their job. Oh, and the lady who served us in the Berliner stuber was nice too. We just came from a steigenberger in Hamburg before arriving at the one in Berlin and it was better. Perhaps people in Berlin are more obnoxious because it's a metropolis like London. Or maybe they just didn't like my face, either way steigenberger Berlin was poor.",

Upon arrival, checked in went up to the room and was very dissappointed. The room was a bit shabby, several cracked tiles in the bathroom and the bed was not kingsize. There was the space for a kingsize bed alright, but two single mattresses had been pushed in and there was a gap between the bedside table and the mattress!! I went down to the reception and gingerly approached the subject of the bed size. There was about 5 Gastapo power dressed receptionists manning the desk at the time, most seemed a bit scary!. Was it because they thought I had got the room too cheap?, it seemed a bit like that to me. Anyway they sent me off to look at another room which was equally as poor. Back down I went and when I produced my bit of paper that clearly said kingsize bed, they gave me the keys of a decent room. Their attitude was shockingly bad and I truly believe they were judging me on my appearance (regular - holiday mode, not powered up though!) and also that I had booked a cheapie.",

The cost is even reasonable but if you require or desire even reasonable internet you won't get it unless you pay an extra 8 Euros per devise per day so it you have 6 devices that makes the hotel no longer competitive or reasonable. The \"free\" Internet may as well not be offered as it does not even offer me the ability to check my email and forget about the ability to stream on any device. It's too bad because this completely frustrating experience is taking away from the obvious & really quite lovely aspects of the hotel. I suggest RAISING THE PRICE by $20 even $30 per night and include good internet because of ALL OF OUR TRAVELS IN THE PAST 30 days (including Skraden, Croatia in a very dated low cost hotel in the middle of nowhere) this is metropolitan 5 star hotel is by far the slowest internet!

    "location": {
      "title": "If it's within the budget, don't hesitate",
      "text": "I refer any intending reader to a review which I posted two or three years ago about the Hayk Hotel in Cologne. My personal details as given there remain the same except for my age. I stayed at the Steigenberger for twelve nights from 21st July last. It was my first stay at this hotel and it was, from first to last, wonderful. The Steigenberger is a seriously international standard hotel. It is expensive, but , as I have said in the heading to this review, anyone who can afford to stay there should not hesitate. More particularly: LOCATION: This could not be better for any traveller arriving in Berlin at the Berlin Hauptbahnhof. It needs to be understood that the Berlin Hbf is a comparatively recent addition to Berlin, dating from about 2006. It is huge: all steel and glass with high and open spaces. It is, at almost any hour of the day or night, busy and noisy. It is fairly clean inside and filthy outside with discarded cigarette butts and general detritus. Is is a fantastic transport hub for any traveller in Berlin, but is not itself actually close to any of the expected tourist must-see sights. At each end of the main building is a large plaza: the Europaplatz at one end and the Washingtonplatz at the other end. A traveller emerging into the Washimgtonplatz will see the Steigenberger on a slight tangent to the right. The inevitable cobblestones are broken by a length of smooth concrete pathway which makes it simple to walk, dragging one's wheels behind one, the very short distance to the hotel entrance. Berlin is a huge and diffuse city and hotel location is of critical importance to the traveller, especially the traveller by train. On the score of location, the Steigenberger is 10/10. ACCOMODATION: I can speak only for the Junior Suite level of accomodation, but based upon that experience I am confident that any room in this hotel would be of good quality. For an occasional indulgence, (and which traveller does not need one of those from time to time?), the Junior Suite is exactly right. It is a large open area in the shape, broadly speaking, of an L. My own Suite was a reversed L. In the shaft of the L was a dressing area and a splendidly appointed bathroom with a square rainfall shower head which gave, for once, a wide and strong flow of water. In the foot of the L were a compact sleeping area and a compact sitting area, each separated from the other by a fixed divider about Four or five feet in height and containg storage cabinets and the TV. One wall faced out onto the Washingtonplatz and was floor to ceiling glass giving wonderful natural light and a feeling of space. Everything was spotlessly clean and excellently maintained. An iron and ironing board were provided upon request, promptly and free of charge. This accomodation was overall one of the best hotel experiences I have had in decades of foreign travel. Wi-Fi: A necessity for the modern day traveller. It was reliable and free of charge. BREAKFAST: This is served in the hotel restaurant, which is a series of connected high and open spaces having a wall of glass facing onto the Wasingtonplatz. As one would expect in a hotel of this standard, the buffet was first class. A team of very pleasant waiters kept things moving. Very much a cut above the normal hotel breakfast buffet, even at three and some four star hotels. RECEPTION AND OTHER STAFF SERVICES: Uniformly pleasant and efficient. A FEW PERSONAL ASSOCIATED SUGGESTIONS: I will include these here rather than attempt a separate posting which will stretch to breaking point my inadequate IT skills. A serious traveller to Berlin should allow not less than a week for the visit. The city is crammed with rare and beautiful things and, with all the good will in the world, attempting to cover them in a couple of frenetic days will only result in blurs rather than memories. The great Berlin art collections are concentrated in two areas each distant from the other. One is the Kulturforum, a complex of uninspiring modern buildings a short walk from the Potsdammerplatz. The must-see is the Gemaldegalerie, one of the greatest collections of paintings in Europe. The nearby Museum of Decorative Arts is well worth a visit. Do not even think of doing both in one day. The Gemaldegalerie itself is huge and takes the better part of a day to visit in any worthwhile way. The other is the quite exceptional collection of museums on the Museum Island. There are five distinct museums and to visit two in one day is the absolute maximum if one is to visit properly. The Pergamon Museum is probably the most famous because of the Pergamon Altar from which it takes its name. But be aware that the Altar itself will not be on display again until after current renovations have been carried out and that is likely to mean two or three years. It is still a must-see for the Market Gate from Miletus and the Ishtar Gate and fragments of the associated Processional Way from Babylon. The nearby New Museum contains the world-renowned bust of Nefertiti, some 3,400 years old and as extraordinarily beautiful as if it had been produced a few years ago. It contains also the Xanten Knabe, an exceptional Roman sculpture. The nearby Old Museum comtains a superb collection of Greek and Roman antiquities in a strikingly handsome building. The nearby Old National Gallery contains splendid examples of German painting of the 18th and 19th C. The Bode Gallery is a striking domed building on the very tip of the Island. It is a magnificent mixed collection of antiquities. Set aside an hour and a half or thereabouts for a stroll along Unter den Linden, one of the great European boulevardes, allowing, as one will have to do for some time yet, for the intrusions caused by major subway and other building construction works. Allow another hour for a stroll around the Gendarmenmarkt which is a superb classical European square framed by three magnificent classical buildings, all of which can be visited, and which make together one of the great classical urban spces in Berlin: I would myself say in Western Europe. If staying for a week, get a seven day travel card. It saves fussing with individual tickets, gives coverage of the entire inner city area and is good value for money.",

      "text": "To begin with, I can't fault the hotel on its facilities and the cleanliness of the hotel in general. Me and 2 friends who are currently travelling around Europe decided to use this as our first hotel. We stayed from 5th August Friday to Monday 8th August . On arrival I was asked to produce a credit card to which the total amount of the cost of the room was charged for our 3 night stay. Originally I had booked a three night stay for two people. Having emailed the hotel through booking.com I then asked the question of would it be possible to add a 3rd person to our booking junior suite. The reply was, that is possible however it would be and extra 57 euros for the 3rd person. Which was agreed. Our stay was fine and on the last day the 3 of us decided to have breakfast before we checked out for the 1st time. I've stayed at a few hotels in Berlin where the breakfast are on par if not better. The \u20ac21 extra is quite steep considering. The coffee is all machined, with a poor selection of teas also. I was a bit bemused with the lack of variety on all fronts on the breakfast. I must stress that the gentleman who takes your room number on entering the breakfast buffet was very polite, charming and welcoming too. On check out we then decided to view the total costs of our stay, where apparently we had 4 breakfasts and for the room that already had cost us a whopping 700 + euros for 3 nights, plus the 57 euros extra for each night for the 3rd person, so it was 800 + euros we were looking at. Can I stress that It was never made clear to us before hand that extra 57 euros was per night (pictures to follow). When I questioned the receptionist, the reply was \"it doesn't say for the whole stay either\". I was asked to then produce my card again to which no pin authorisation was put through the machine. Without realising, I was charged again for the whole stay. From Berlin we moved on to Poland. This is where I found a problem in using my card. Having asked the my bank in the UK via telephone, what could be the problem? Their reply was, there is outstanding payment from the Steigenburger hotel in Berlin that's waiting to clear. I was thinking how could that be? To my surprise I have found out since, that the hotel had charged me 700 + euros on arrival and on departure a further 800 + euros for a 3 night stay. It is now the 15th August and I'm currently in Poland with no money, this has been the case for the past 7 days, as my money that they have has still not be received. When I rang the hotel about this they had no recollection whatsoever on any of their accounts, and we're very abrupt and unhelpful on this matter. I had to call again after numerous conversations with my bank in the UK to try and provide proof of this mistake whilst trying travel through Poland. I must stress I booked this hotel through booking.com where the room was agreed to be \u20ac588 for 3 nights, adding a 3rd person was what I thought would be an extra \u20ac57 as a whole but wasn't, it ended up per night! Which is fine, but clearly not made clear (check photos) .Then the 3 breakfasts on the last day at \u20ac21 . So the total cost for 3 nights came in at around \u20ac820 plus taxes on top of that. Please be aware of the hidden charges with this hotel. I'm not a fan of negativity and I've stayed at many good hotels and I also understand their processes, however this has put a very sour taste in my mouth considering the situation I'm now in through this mistake. This mistake has had a catastrophic effect on my holiday and there's not much I can do until I receive this money back. The money I am now waiting for stuck in Poland, according to my bank is \u00a3731.",

      "title": "Superb hotel",
      "text": "What a great hotel. One of the best I've ever stayed at. Room was warm and comfortable and ultra-modern. Super quiet, I never heard a peep from other guests or from anything outside. Room had all kinds of goodies, like a rainfall shower head, an easy-to-operate room safe (with a light that illuminated the interior), a coffee maker, and an electric kettle with a variety of top-quality herbal teas. Bed was extremely comfortable and I slept soundly. Flat-panel TV mounted on wall right above a large desk with abundant electrical outlets for my laptop. I was a tourist in Berlin, and I think I spent more time in my room than I should have because it was so wonderful. Other reviews have mentioned the staff and their cool behavior, but that was not my experience. The staff treated me cordially and efficiently. I arrived and tried to check in using my imperfect German, which I generally do at hotels in Germany. I got half-way through the check-in process when the man started speaking very rapidly and he lost me. I told him he was speaking very fast, and he smiled and said he would be happy either to switch to English or to continue in German but more slowly, whichever I preferred. I thought that was a very kind thing to do, and it added to my impression of this hotel as a very classy place. A few oddities at this hotel, but nothing major. The door to the bathroom was glass. Mostly frosted glass, but not entirely. And, for reasons that I cannot even begin to understand, there was a very chic floor-to-ceiling window in the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. Totally clear glass. That made the bathroom seem airy and spacious, but it also meant that anyone in the room outside the bathroom could see every square inch of your naked body while you showered. I suppose this is okay if you're sharing the room with a spouse, but it could make for some rather awkward moments if you are traveling with a friend or other relative. (In fairness to this hotel, I've stayed at other Berlin hotels, and many of them have voyeur-friendly bathrooms as well. I have no idea why.) Also, the room has no ironing board or iron, which I have come to expect in many U.S. hotels. One minor complaint was the WiFi. They offer a free WiFi connection, but it's really slow and only good for email and very light Web browsing. Pages would take anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds to load. You can purchase a faster connection directly from your laptop for something like 8 euros a day. I had to sign in repeatedly to the free connection using my room number and last name, but it was always there and always worked. The best part of this hotel is its location right next to the main train station (the Hauptbahnhof). When I go to Europe, I like to stay in a big city and take day trips to outlying towns. That was very easy at this Steigenberger, and I even managed a day trip to Prague, amazingly. You can leave your hotel room, walk to the station, and be on your train platform easily within 10 minutes. When you return at night, you step off the train and are back in your hotel room just as swiftly, and if it's been a long day you grab a Whopper and some fries at the Burger King on the way back to the hotel. It was great. Breakfast was 25 euros unless your room rate included it (mine didn't). I skipped breakfast and simply walked to the train station across the street every morning. (There is a small food court there that is pretty deserted in the morning. I would get a fruit cup with yogurt and hot chocolate and read the paper.) The only real drawback of this hotel is its location for tourists who might want to stay in a livelier neighborhood of Berlin. This hotel is close enough to the main train station that you feel the pulse of the city and you have some shopping and food options within easy reach, but it's nothing like the Kudamm or other parts of Berlin with a richer nightlife. However, I really enjoyed my stay here and would be happy to return on my next Berlin visit. Also note that there is a bus on the \"TXL\" line that runs from Tegel Airport to the main train station and stops very close to this hotel. Fare was less than 3 euros, versus a 20- to 25-euro cab fare. (But the TXL bus during rush hour can be very crowded.)",

      "title": "A Very Disappointing Experience",
      "text": "I have rated the Steigenberger Hotel Am Kanzleramt a generous 2/5 on the basis that it is a very well located Hotel with beautiful interior, but sadly let down by its staff. I have stayed in many 5 star Hotels in my time but this is not even close. My girlfriend and I were over for a weekend visiting my brother in order to experience the best that Berlin had to offer. What we found is that better hotels lie elsewhere in the City (Titanic Gendarmenmarkt Hotel Berlin for one is definitely worth considering) and that you shouldn't waste your time in a hotel that doesn't look after its residents properly. What I liked about the Steigenberger is sadly the things that lack the human touch, i.e how lovely the entrance is that you are greeted with, the beautiful spiral staircase which is situated at the centre of the Hotel and had a tree undecorated beside it on our arrival. We were made to wait a little before checking in as one woman attended to another couple beside us and the person we were waiting for was busy on the phone. Another group who had just arrived after us decided they would skip us in the queue to the right. Nothing was said about this by either of the women at the reception desk at the time. Pure ignorance I guess. No service was offered to carry our bags to our hotel room (we decided to put this down to lack of staff but in most 5 star hotels there is a porter ever present for all guests). As I was with my brother at the time I told him to come up as my girlfriend and I dropped off our bags into our hotel room for the 2 nights. After leaving the hotel and meeting my sister and her partner that had travelled all the way from London and arrived at the nearby train station, we went to get something to eat in the nearby Shopping centre in the main square. As it was getting late we decided to just go for a drink or two in the Hotel bar. It was a Friday night and it wasn't that busy but even then the service was extremely slow. However, as we were in no rush anywhere this night it was totally fine to wait for the cocktails we had ordered but even one of the female bar staff sniggered at an order from my sister's boyfriend. I'm not sure if there was a slight language barrier with some of the bar staff but again we just decided to let this incident slip. The following day we set out from the hotel after a good night's sleep and did an open bus trip tour of the city which had its buses conveniently parked right outside of our hotel. I would strongly recommend people doing this, we really had great fun getting on and off at all the various sites in Berlin. Having seen the Berlin wall and been all around the city we went onto visit Berlin's Victory Column & The Berlin TV tower. The 360\u00b0 view from the top of the tower is something to behold with a beverage in hand. My advice is get VIP tickets for the full experience. Worth noting that the German man we met there in the lift on the way up was far friendlier than any of the hotel staff we met in the Steigenberger who lacked any personality or that human warmth you would expect from a Hotel of its standing. These were two unforgettable experiences I will always share with my brother, my girlfriend, my sister and her boyfriend. It's quite funny, as come to think of it, most of our great experiences actually occurred outside of the hotel we resided in! Upon our return at around 8pm (it wasn't late) we decided as a group to give the Hotel bar a second chance. If I could turn the clocks back I would definitely have decided against this and perhaps I expected too much maybe of the Steigenberger hotel. We found ourselves a table as the bar began to get extremely busy on a Saturday night. Upon sitting down at our table we were almost completely ignored for a while as it was an extremely busy bar. There were about 2 bar staff that I could see working on the floor. Many bartenders behind the bar but not a lot happening with residents of the hotel and indeed customers who decided to walk in off the street. After asking for a menu we then waited for what seemed like an eternity before someone came back to attend to our table. The lack of attention to customers was quite incredible. One young man who we ushered to the table took our order. He was very smily and cruising around the bar but not really doing his job properly. We waited at least 15 minutes before he returned to tell us that the drink my girlfriend had ordered was not available. She took a moment to give an alternative order but we were not happy at how long it took for him to come back and tell us that the drink she had ordered would be an issue. This is clearly something which he should have known right away and communicated so as not to frustrate guests who are looking to enjoy their final evening together. When our drinks did eventuallly come after multiple times of asking where they were, to which we got the response just, \"Coming!\", two of them were extremely watered down due to them sitting at the bar and not being brought to our table most likely. It must be pointed out that the drinks were reasonably priced but terrible quality. When my girlfriend's drink did finally arrive 45 minutes later we had all nearly finished our first drink at that stage. I asked the girl who had placed it at our table did she think that this was acceptable service? She replied, \"No\" and smiled a little before she went off. I cannot believe that no one even offered an apology in the first instance. The young man who had been attending to us initially when we sat down came back as I asked could I speak to a manager. He informed me that the manager was not present on a busy Saturday night (which I found hard to believe). He came back minutes later and offered to strike my girlfriend's drink order off the bill. We were still visibly agitated by the whole experience especially as we were residents of the hotel and paid a lot more than most hotels for a stay in this particular place where you expect them to live up to their both stated and unstated values. I went straight up to the bar and demanded that I speak to someone in authority. They directed me to the reception desk. I took the bill and went to reception to ask for a Supervisor. To my utter astonishment, I got the same generic response, \"I am sorry Sir there is no Supervisor present tonight.\" I explained what had happened to both the man and woman at the reception desk who were present and they were utterly professional advising me that a Certain Mr. H would be the person I need to speak to the following morning offering their apologies. They also informed me that he starts working at 5:30, I replied, \"Great, thanks! Good night\", as we intended to check out of the Hotel earlier than expected. All in all, this left us with a very sour taste of the Steigenberger as my brother left us to go home. The next morning we had Cleaning ladies persistently banging on our door looking to get into our room and I assume set up for the next \"lucky\" guests staying in the Hotel. We told them \u2013 not once, not twice, but 3 times \u2013 that we would be out within 20 minutes. I finally got to speak to Mr H. He immediately ushered me away from the Hotel desk as other guests were checking into the hotel and I can only imagine he did not want them to hear of our discomforting experience publicly like that. I am taking to this forum so as to inform future potential guests of our stay and so that perhaps you won't fall into the similar trap as we did reading all the great trip advisor reviews and understand the pitfalls of this Hotel. As far as I am concerned, you are only as good as your last performance and this one was definitely sub standard. I said quite clearly that I would like to lodge a complaint as we were extremely disappointed with our stay in The Steigenberger. Mr H. started off quite well as he sat us down and asked us to explain to him exactly what had happened the night before. He asked, courteously, did we have time to speak. We duly obliged as this is important feedback the hotel should take very seriously especially within the Hospitality industry. He assured us immediately that last night was an absolute exception and that usually either a Manager/Supervisor would be present there to speak to in the Hotel. We told him that we had been extremely let down by all of his Hotel staff at nearly every instance and explained the whole episode in the bar on both nights. He didn't quite seem to understand how we felt and in fact started to focus purely on things that we said were not poor with our experience, like our rooms, the beds etc. I told him that we were absolutely not paying the bill from the bar as this was by far the most terrible experience we had on our entire Berlin trip. He immediately attempted to distance himself from the bar which, last time I checked, is considered part of the Hotel in its entirety. He said he needed a few words with the other Supervisor on at the time. *Note now how we all of a sudden have not one, but TWO Supervisors on at the desk! I wish they were so \"on it\" the night before. After much heated conversation and in an event where the hotel were completely in the wrong I told Mr H. that the \"ball was completely in his court\" to decide what to do with us. He came back with an initially \"the best I can do is 20% off the bill\" offer. I thought that he meant our entire Hotel bill but what in fact he meant was our drinks bill from the previous night which totalled a meagre \u20ac64. I was insulted by this \"solution\" and told him to go back and reconsider what had happened again. He came back with \"I would like to offer you a return night's stay with us in our Hotel..\" I looked at him in disbelief as what I was telling him was that we wouldn't ever want to stay in this hotel again, especially after how we had been treated whilst we were there the entire time. Finally, I took the bill up to the desk and said explained to them that there was no way that I was happy paying for the terribly bad experience we had the night before and demanded to check out immediately. The person who dealt with us at the desk remained calm as he provided us with our boarding passes for the airport. I thanked him for them and we went on our way. We couldn't get out of that Hotel quicker so that we could experience Germany's unique history \u2013 visit the nearby Reichstag building which is home to the German parliament, see the Brandenburg Gate, see the amazing abstract art sculpture of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in the Friedrichstadt neighborhood and even visit the Berlin Zoo. All of these experiences - in which the Hotel were not directly involved in - made our trip! My last words to Mr H. was that we were the type of people who honestly write reviews on Trip Advisor so that others are not unfairly misinformed. I would never wish this sort of experience to occur to anyone else so this is why I have taken the time to write in detail what happened on our trip. Please note that it has taken me over 2 weeks to calm down and properly reflect on the experience and formulate my sincerest thoughts. Go to Berlin, witness its amazing unique culture, try the markets where the people are so friendly, try the famous Currywurst, the mulled wine, the numerous different treats and arts and craft the markets have to offer. All of this is amazing and something I will never forget!! For heaven's sake though, after all that I have said here, please do yourself a favour and kindly don't choose to stay in this Hotel. We most certainly won't be back.",

Very convenient in particularly if you arriving to Berlin from international trains or traveling as a grown up interrailing. Also very convenient if you arrive at night (not our case) and or have a very little time to spare in Berlin (our case) It was not the cheapest of the hotels but for European standards, Berlin and that category of hotel, this was in a way acceptable for what we needed at that time.",

When booking there was an option to select a double or queen bed of which we had selected a queen bed. When entering the room there were two twin beds with separate duvets. Rang reception and explained our situation of which the answer was we dont do double beds in this hotel but there is a room with a double (confusing) We were then removed to the back of the hotel next to a train station and found that two twin beds had been disguised as a double with a mattress topper but still two single duvets. Pillows were of poor quality and on a few occasions the way the new sheets had been placed on beds was of very poor quality, definitely not of five star quality. Also no bath in the room, something not made clear on the hotels web site. Having read trip advisor reviews after the trip it became apparent that you need to ask for a bath. To me the hotel needs to be more proactive in the services it provides rather then forcing the customer to have to ask after having feeling disatisfied. Requests should be addressed and told beforehand if they cannot be fulfilled and a room of the same quality should always be provided instead of being shunted for expressing concerns. As we were removed next to a train combined with the poor air con facility we were unable to open windows as during our stay it was very hot.",

The bathroom was nice as well with a large shower, a sink and a toilet separated from the rest of the bathroom by a door. The breakfast (25\u20ac I think, but we booked with breakfast included) was very good. To improve: it's free seating, so as a family of 4, it wasn't easy to find a table. When we did, we had to put the tables together and they were still dirty from previous guests. The staff wasn't super friendly at the breakfast and seemed very busy: they were clearly short staffed and didn't have time to clean up the tables in time. The fitness and spa area , at the 7th floor, was very pleasant. Nice staff members welcome you, explain you everything you need to know and are available if you need. The fitness room is well equipped and gives you a splendid view on Berlin as you're working out! The spa has a resting area, foot baths, showers, three saunas and a steam bath. There is relaxing music playing and plenty of places to lay down. It was a very relaxing and pleasant moment for me! The reception staff was very nice and always there if you need anything, so we appreciated that. There was one dark side to our stay: the wifi. They don't have their own wifi but go through a hotspot provider called \"the cloud\". They explained us at the check-in that we could pick the high speed wifi, which cost 8\u20ac/day, and that it would be paid for by the hotel. This confused us a little bit as we had never seen that before and were afraid it would be charged to us. Hopefully, we didn't see that on our hotel bill :) In our room, we had a very poor wifi coverage: disconnection all the time, poor speed, one, sometimes no signal bars... We told the staff about it: it seems like it was a known issue and they were very nice about it, offering to change rooms (thank you if you are reading this). We had a new room for the last two nights: same one but with a view on the train station instead of no view! The coverage was indeed better, and the speed improved a little bit but it was still very slow for a \"high speed\": 5 mb/s, 10 at the best. Also, the high speed access is only intended for 2 devices but, again, the reception staff helped us by giving us 24h additional access cards! We were very happy about how the reception staff helped us with the issues. I just hope the wifi will be improved to the standards of a 5 star hotel!",

Finally, I took the bill up to the desk and said explained to them that there was no way that I was happy paying for the terribly bad experience we had the night before and demanded to check out immediately. The person who dealt with us at the desk remained calm as he provided us with our boarding passes for the airport. I thanked him for them and we went on our way. We couldn't get out of that Hotel quicker so that we could experience Germany's unique history \u2013 visit the nearby Reichstag building which is home to the German parliament, see the Brandenburg Gate, see the amazing abstract art sculpture of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in the Friedrichstadt neighborhood and even visit the Berlin Zoo. All of these experiences - in which the Hotel were not directly involved in - made our trip! My last words to Mr H. was that we were the type of people who honestly write reviews on Trip Advisor so that others are not unfairly misinformed. I would never wish this sort of experience to occur to anyone else so this is why I have taken the time to write in detail what happened on our trip. Please note that it has taken me over 2 weeks to calm down and properly reflect on the experience and formulate my sincerest thoughts. Go to Berlin, witness its amazing unique culture, try the markets where the people are so friendly, try the famous Currywurst, the mulled wine, the numerous different treats and arts and craft the markets have to offer. All of this is amazing and something I will never forget!! For heaven's sake though, after all that I have said here, please do yourself a favour and kindly don't choose to stay in this Hotel. We most certainly won't be back.",

      "title": "Central Location & A Perfect End to a Busy Day!",
      "text": "We stayed here in February and were attracted to the location, and the hot tubs initially! We have been in Berlin before, and were always walking well over 15000 steps each day, so we thought that a nice relaxing soak at the end of each day would be perfect- and it was! Location wise- this place was right in the centre of everything. You have the TV tower a 5 minute walk away. The Berlin Cathedral and Museum Island is around the corner. Alexanderplatz is 10 minutes away- and super easily accessible from the trams at the corner of the street if you don't feel like the walk. There is a H\u00e4agen-Dazs cafe a stones throw away, as well as a Weihenstephan pub with a lovely little beer garden. You could come to Berlin and see plenty just staying here! In terms of the more day-to-day stuff, the hotel is less than 5 minutes away from a tram line, train station and main road with buses, and 10 mins from Alexanderplatz station, so is ideal to link to other areas of the city. There is Kaisers, and a bank that doesnt charge extra around the back of the hotel, again about 3 minutes away. Or there is a Netto, which is more of a budget supermarket, which is just across the square, going towards Alexanderplatz. Again, no more than 10 minutes away. You really have everything you need. The hotel itself was exactly as I expected. We were welcomed by staff, and even though we were early in checking in, the front desk were happy to help. While we had emailed in advance requesting a room higher up, we were given a room on the second floor. However, we may have been able to get one higher up if we had checked in later. The option was given to wait until later on, but we felt it would be best to get rid of our bags and begin exploring Berlin. The staff were always friendly and polite, and said hello each time we passed. They were more than helpful with any questions, and even changed some higher notes for us to more manageable money. Nothing was too much hassle! The room was stunning and spotless. Modernly decorated to a high standard, and laid out very well. the safe was easy to use, and we were able to comfortably unpack in the massive wardrobes. The bed was big and comfy, and there was a seating area and a dining table- we were actually able to have freinds who were staying in the other room join us some evenings for drinks without us all having to sit on the bed! The kitchen area was small, but well equipped and certainly had everything we needed. I wouldn't recommend making a family meal in it, but it was sufficient for a light lunch, and certainly more than would be provided in any normal hotel. The fridge was the highlight for us, as it meant we were able to stock up on lovely, cheap beer at the supermarket and have it perfectly chilled at the end of the night! There was a mini bar option which was actually fairly reasonably priced compared with others I have seen, but it is much cheaper just to stock up on your own supplies at the supermarkets nearby. The wifi was acceptable, and I never had any issues getting connected, but it is worth noting that you can only connect 2 devices per room, so choose wisely! Cleaning staff come in each day to make the beds and replace any towels. You can opt for a more eco friendly option by reusing your towels if you like, and there is a special door hanger to put on if you just want a quick going over in the room, with no harsh chemicals. The sheets are changed every 3 mights, which I really didn't mind, but you can request that they are changed every day. For anyone complaining about the cleaning/ sheets situation- read the manual- it is all in there :) One of the best attractions at this hotel was the Jacuzzi hot-tubs in the spa area. I used them at least 3 nights, and they were just what we needed after a long day of touristy fun. It is worth noting that there is no swimming pool in this hotel, despite listings on some websites, there is only the hot-tubs and sauna. The hotel has a no-glass policy in the spa area, but we were still able to enjoy cocktails and wine while relaxing there, we just put our drinks into plastic glasses. You can get lovely plastic glasses and bottles at the nearby primark for around 4 Euro, and it fits a bottle of wine, beer or fruitsecco into it easily! - top tip there!! The sauna is also lovely to relax in, particularly after a cold Berlin day! Although I will mention that you may see nakedness there! Being from the UK, this was a surprise to me at first, but it is seemingly quite common in Germany and you get used to it. There was also a bar which served gorgeous cocktails, and the happy hour deals made them so much more inviting! There was a food menu, but we were so spoiled for choice with the surrounding area that I never tried it. Maybe next time! Other facilities included a gym, which I never set foot in- I'm allergic to exercise hehe, there is a court yard which seems to be the go-to space for smokers, and there is also a shared computer in the lobby with internet access. This is ideal if you want to look up something on google maps, then snap a pic of it before you go to save your mobile data charges! The hotel is really secure as you need to use your room keys in order to access the lifts and stairwells. This was quite reassuring, especially as we were in a very busy area. There was an issue with the temperature of the room, but we had seen in previous reviews that this was the case. We set the air con in the room to the absolute lowest temperature it would allow (17 degrees), and we were still far too hot to sleep, so we switched the air con off, and opened the window ( If you have this problem, don't open the window while the air con is on as it will overcompensate for the cold air, and blast out much warmer air- common sense there, but thought I would mention it) What was more irritating is that every time we went out, the cleaning staff would switch the air con back on and close the windows, so it was roasting again whenever we came in!! Luckily it wasn't too cold outside, so we were able to sleep with windows open. I would suggest to the management that the temperature is lowered on the air con as I can imagine this would be awful in the summer. Another small issue was that by the end of the night, in the spa area, there were no robes left. It seems people take them back to their rooms, and forget to return them! I think the hotel would be able to resolve this by providing the robes in the rooms themselves, as opposed to the spa area. Overall, we loved our stay at the Adina, and we look forward to coming back. The small negative issues mentioned were not enough to impact our overall experience. I would love to see this feedback being used to make some small changes in the Adina to make it better than ever.",

      "text": "I stayed here for 3 nights for a long weekend with my girlfriend and found the hotel to be very pleasant, clean and nicely presented for a quick romantic getaway. The rooms are reasonably spacious and they even offered to put us in a bigger room that was available at no extra cost to accommodate my girlfriend's wheelchair. The rooms are, as the name suggests, presented as little studio apartments which is a nice touch. The kitchenette in the room was adequate though I can't imagine actually cooking a proper meal in it (it is somewhat squeezed into an already quite cluttered room, in fact, the room would probably have been more pleasant without it!). The bed was huge and comfortable, slightly hard with a range of pillows to suit individual needs. The bathroom was clean and functional apart from the sink which was very shallow and chosen for style rather than practicality. Hairdryer, iron etc were all useful inclusions. The decor won't be to everyone's taste but I thought it was pleasant and stylish in a retro way. The wellness area is very nice and has 2 decent jacuzzi pools that are very relaxing if you can find 5 minutes where you can be alone in them. The gym seemed ok, a bit small perhaps but ok. The downsides for me personally were all the extras. Bear in mind that this is coming from a traveller who doesn't usually stay in smart hotels so these things may actually be normal for all I know but, judging from some comments on here, this isn't the case. I've stayed in hostels that offer more stuff as standard than this hotel. They don't offer free wifi in the room which is strange considering the price. The free wifi in the lobby is fine and now comes in 3 hour installments, not 1 hour as others have complained about. The minibar is a tad expensive considering it doesn't offer much- it offers probably the worst beer in Germany and a rather cheap looking selection of wines. Again, it doesn't seem proportional to the price of the room. The breakfast looked a good quality, varied spread but I couldn't personally justify paying 19 Euros for a breakfast no matter how good it is and, for a buffet, this seems very expensive. There is a lovely bakery just down the road past the railway bridge that offers a nice selection of cakes and pastries for 1 Euro each. If you are on a budget, eating out is probably the best option for you. The restaurant menu looked ok and prices were competitive though I didn't eat there so I can't comment on the quality. The location is excellent, a short walk from Alexanderplatz and Hackescher Market which has a decent selection of restaurants and bars around it. Museum island is also right next door and the main Champs-Elysses esque street that has the Brandenberg Gate etc is nearby. The neighborhood is in no way 'seedy' as some have suggested, it is in a very central location. You will possibly see gangs of drunken tourists on stag parties passing but they are usually on their way elsewhere. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I can't fault them at all and they made everything hassle free. On the whole I really liked this hotel despite the few drawbacks that will put some people off. It is sometimes available at very reasonable rates on booking websites and if you happen to drop on one of these deals it is well worth taking advantage of. If the extra costs seem high, bear in mind that I had a very nice time and used most of the facilities at no extra cost at all and you won't be short of places to eat and drink out so don't let it put you off!",

      "title": "Second stay and best commodation (5STARS) Must read!",
      "text": "I stayed in this Adina apartments at hackecher markt for the second time in January 2016. Ones i came in they regonise me. Thanks to the fantastic Ursula at the reception she made me felt comfortable and welcome to the stay and remembers me from my first preview stay over 2 years ago. Ive requested the very same room ive previously stayed in. The request can not be guarantee but eventually i got the room i wanted. I was on the top floor. Separate room/kitchen with a small living area with tv and sofa. Long balcony in both corner views. There are 2 tv's one in the bedroom and one in the dine/living room. With both remote controls. The whole apartment was rather warm. Very quiet not heard a noice from the outside at all. The bed was comfortable enough. There was curtains to block the day light sun coming in the rooms (the type of curtains you usually find at theater cinema rooms) The working kitchen with a microwave and utilities. and water cattle to boil the water. Along with the dishwasher machine. But there was no type plates that i could think of that is suitable for microwave to heat up a meal. Instead i had to buy a temporary plate just for heating the meal in the microwave. One thing it did not had was a oven. Unfortunately the kitchen was rather tight and small but that didn't bother me much at all since much of the time i end up buying take away food. The fridge is small/medium but space enough to fit most things. There are pre chocolate and pre drinks available in the room already for you such as alcohol/soft drinks such as coke/mini water bottles/ Snacks peanuts and chocolates for a treat. I didn't used any of that as it will had cost me each item. So instead i went to buy my own grocery food which is around the corner of the hotel which was just close enough to buy things. Bathroom with a spacious area. Only shower, There was complimentary of free mini hotel moisturizer and small soap/conditioner plus it had a very good quality hair driver (not the type you usually see stuck against the wall with a cable) This one is just plug into the wall socket. There was this kind of metal bars to heat the towels from 1 to 5 level heat. Con: However the apartment was comfortable and pretty cool place to stay but it is rather tight and or rather small with less space in between. The bedroom was rather tight so not much of space to move around as the walls was close to the surrounded of the bed. And the kitchen was tiny but good enough. The dine/living area tiny but all that was next to the kitchen on the side. Bad thing was: there was no washing machine to wash clothes. Instead it had to be done taken away for cleaning or wash the clothes in the shower like the old days. The room i stayed had no washing machine. but some parts of this hotel does have washing machine on different type rooms. It would had been good to include a washing machine in this top level apartment of the hotel. The internet. Fantastic and pleasure to have the free WIFI availability to use the internet when needed every days while staying in. (also they offer cable in room if you need to but must pay for that) TV had a few channels and some are just german channels and some in english such BBC news/World Disney channel in english and some other ones in english mainly coming directly from the UK speaking language. Other then that interesting channels in german always showing the history that made germany from world war 2 to documentaries. The breakfast downstairs as you pre-booked this or when you arrive at the hotel you receive breakfast vouchers. (Present one each morning you go to the restaurant beside the reception). It is a large Buffet breakfast. One of the BEST breakfast buffet in its high quality ive ever encountered. I totally recommend you choose breakfast buffet with your stay. There was lots of variety from bancakes to apple/orange/organic juices from cheese to tomatoes/ boil eggs/diferent kind of teas/coffee/diferent kind of cereals about 3 diferent kinds/ and diferent type breads and you can help yourself making your own bread toast/from strawberry jams to orange jams and some other type organics as well/Some delicate yummy morning deserts to even ask them to make you scrumble eggs if you want to. The moment you walk into the restaurant they greet you and they come to you and they give you coffee and they ask for your room number and you present the voucher to them. So the big highlights of this apartment was the nice people at the reception specially that spanish lady whos name is Ursula who she remembers my name and each time i walk in and out of the hotel they greet me and and i felt like a VIP presisential kind of person. It felt very welcome everydays i went in and out of the hotel always hello have a nice day and welcome back in. So thanks to the reception they made my stay the best i could ask for. I totally recommended this place but rememeber there are diferent type rooms From apartment to studio type rooms. Not all rooms may have superb views. But the one i stayed was good enough with a view for a treat. I will come back and hopefully i get to stay in the very same room. The best thing i enjoy first was the nice people at the reception which made me felt very welcome in and out constantly/ The buffet breakfast big 5 stars recommended/The free WIFI internet made the stay fantastic which was the best thing to have in the room. And last was the apartment room which was a great place to stay with the separate bedroom and separate kitchen & large balcony with views. Thanks Adina i will sure to return soon again. Thanks to the fantastic receptionist who help me all thru my stay (Ursula) I hope i got name right :) Muchas gracias. Regards Juan from australia",

      "text": "The hotel location is one of the best in a lively part of Berlin. It has the advantage of being very close (less than 50 meters from the S-Bahn) and in an area blessed with a rich history, culture, authentic restaurants and affordable retail fashions. The Hotel itself does all the basic things well except that there is no concierge service (the front desk staff and a bartender named Andrew have occasionally provided me with concierge service during my week long stay but only if they were not otherwise occupied with their real jobs. It is hard to consider this hotel as a four star hotel as it has been rated without a proper concierge service. The service that I find the most disappointing, however, is the poor internet access. I was obligated to use the hotel internet in either their lobby or their bar in order to avoid additional charges which add approximately $15 to the daily room charge. I must admit that I am spoiled by the ubiquitous and inexpensive nature of internet in Canada. Most hotels provide internet service at no additional charge and few would expect their guests to use only the lobby or bar in order to receive free internet. It is unfortunate that this otherwise pleasant hotel do not provide a proper concierge service or provide more accessible or more affordable internet given that it is now 2012 and both services make a difference, at least to this traveller.",

      "title": "Great location but sleeping...not so good",
      "text": "After 5 weeks travel in Europe, 6 days in Berlin was a real highlight. This hotel was a big part of helping as it is in a great location with plenty of public transport very close by. The hotel is clean, reasonably friendly BUT I am only giving it a medium rating. I don't like marking a place down without good reason and that reason here is the sleep quality. Given that sleeping is the main priority for us in Berlin (re. hotel), as we were out nearly all day looking around, I really wanted to just kick back in the hotel and get a really good nights sleep. I like a cool room to sleep in and the weather during our stay should have helped with quite chilly conditions but the room was always too warm. The bed was excellent but the pillows were so soft that my head just rested on the mattress and the doona/duvet was way too thick for me. The hotel did help with lighter duvets (two single ones on the queen bed) and although they advertised a range of different pillows they only had one alternative that they supplied which was a bit better but still not very supportive. I tried opening both windows, turning the room temp controller down to 18 as it didn't go any lower but it would sometimes be cool and other times the room felt much warmer. I did try to speak to the Manager at one stage and the staff member on reception disappeared into the office behind reception to get him/her. The staff member returned, without the manager, and told me that they were aware of the problem and would give us the different pillow and try and find a different duvet. Interesting I thought. I want to say to people reading this review that I am very reluctant to write a review that is critical without good reason. To give you a context to this, we stayed at our first ever airbnb accom in Dubrovnik a week later. Not only was it a beautiful unit in great location, the pillows were fantastic and the a nice light duvet with two different options in the cupboards. The Manager/owner checked in with us to see if these were comfortable enough for sleeping and to let us know if we needed anything further. This was half the price of the Adina with double the comfort and communication. A stark contrast in my eyes.",

There just couldn't be a better location to stay in Berlin! 3. The rooms are spacious, well-equipped, very clean, and we felt like we could stay there forever (almost). 4. It is right near Hackescher Market where there are lots of restaurants, and the scene is just a lively one...really nice vibe! 5. The staff is ok, helpful, but they could have smiled more. The Bad: 1. The policy for the wifi is an awful one! They say that wifi is free in the lobby area. However, every time you want to use the wifi, you have to go to the front desk for a slip of paper which has a username and password. This only lasts for one hour! Then you have to go back again. You could tell that this irritated the guests as much as the staff members at the desk. People kept interrupting them while they were checking in/out guests to get this slip of paper. Come on, Adina, it is NOT that complicated! Figure the wifi out so it is not so burdensome to use. While you're at it, just make wifi free throughout the hotel. This is 2014!! Wifi is a necessity, not a luxury good!! Would I stay there again? Definitely!! I loved the location and the rooms were perfect! Just figure the wifi out please please please!!",

      "text": "Berlin was our 4th stop on our month long honeymoon adventure through Europe. We had 3 of 3 amazing hotels by the time we got to Adina so we had come quite fond of the high level of customer service in our European travels so far. We found Adina to be fairly easy to get to from the train at the nearby outdoor market. At first, not knowing Berlin, the location seemed great. Close to this cool market and not a lot of touristy crap right outside our door. Just what we look for. We checked in and the staff was fine. Nothing negative yet here but just mentioning we didn't feel any sense of the type of friendliness and welcoming we had received in our last 3 hotels in Europe. (Now's a good time to explain one of the main reasons we were excited about Adina and chose to stay there. Their website and reviews all mention that every room has a washer/dryer. Since we were on a month long trip, we packed for 2 weeks and planned to do our laundry at Adina while we stayed in Berlin. ) BEGINNING OF LAUNDRY NONSENSE. (Feel free to read this drama that lost Adina 1 full star or just scan down...I notate the end of the drama with the washer/dryer). We checked in to our room and immediately look around. Really nice size room. Wrap around balcony on the top floor. It was pretty cool...at first. We look for the washer/dryer but don't find one. We double and triple check everywhere but can't find this mythical washer/dryer. As we walk out of the hotel, we ask the front desk and the gentlemen chuckles at us and says it's right behind the door in the bathroom. We obviously feel a little silly now although we both could have sworn we checked thoroughly. We head out for the afternoon. When we get back to the room and look in the bathroom, not finding anything new, we call downstairs and the front desk makes me feel completely insane. The woman tells me it's right there! Look behind the door. We look everywhere. Am I totally stupid? I call back and the woman at the front desk sounds frustrated now. I go down to the front desk hoping she can explain it to me better. While I'm standing in front of her, she calls my room and obnoxiously directs my wife around the room looking for a washer/dryer. Now I'm getting pissed because we might not be local, but unless the German washing machines are the size of a soda can, there isn't one in that room. My wife obviously never finds it. The front desk woman pouts a bit and reluctantly offers to escort me up to my room to show me where there washer/dryer is. In the elevator, I felt so stupid as the woman looked at me with these belittling looks. We walk into the room and she walks straight to the bathroom, pulls the door open and looks behind it. She stops for a minute and looks around the rest of the room, peeking into a couple of other corners. My wife and I soon start to realize we were correct and that the the two staff members are just ignorant and obnoxious. The woman, completely mortified, bows down as she walks backwards to the door apologizing profusely and saying she'll work on a solution. An hour or so later she says they have a room for us with a washer/dryer. We pack up our things and move to the new room. Indeed!...a washer/dryer in the bathroom. Now, they don't have any washing detergent (how can this be) so we had to walk to the corner store to buy some. After one load, I suggest to my wife that we run the dryer to make sure it works. The washer/dryer are fairly small and it seemed that anything more than a few t-shirts would overwhelm both machines. The first load we did was very small but it took about 4 hours to dry. I swear I'm not exaggerating. We had to run it all night. A few t-shirts, socks and boxers/underwear. I can see it taking some time but it didn't really seem to work very well at all. We finally realize that this was a horrible plan. We could have easily just stayed at a great hotel and dropped our laundry off somewhere. END OF LAUNDRY NONSENSE We go out for the night and come to understand why Adina's rooms are so large and the price is so inexpensive. It's not a great location at night. Sketchy. We actually didn't feel safe (and I'm from NYC). Is it horrible?...no. And if you have a family and need space, it could definitely work. But after spending 4 days in Berlin, we found much better areas to stay in that had a much warmer feel and a better overall Berlin experience. (We loved West Berlin much more than East!) We only stayed that one night. Adina partially refunded us and we checked out early. The manager was great and apologetic for her colleagues' behavior. We used HotelTonight and found an amazing room at The Intercontinental. It changed our entire Berlin experience. If you need to stay at Adina, you might be fine but there's def better options for the same money.",

      "text": "If you're looking for a luxury hotel with a prime location, look no further than the Adlon Kempinski. In researching Berlin, I was conflicted between a couple hotels, in various areas of town. I tend to like smaller, more interesting properties, and having never been to Berlin, I considered a more hip, high-end option near the Zoo. At the toss of a coin, I chose the Adlon, which turned out to be the definitive right answer. As in any city, location is everything, and in Berlin, this is especially important. Berlin is a very spread out city, with no real city center. No matter where you stay, you'll end up taking cabs, but obviously, you want this minimized. The Adlon sits right next to the Brandenburg Gate and the Tiergarten park, a beautiful and safe place to run or walk. In addition, the Reichstag is a very short walk away, making the Adlon a prime location for touring historical Berlin. Equally as important, the Adlon is the closest luxury option to the old Jewish Quarter, the locale of many of the city's best restaurants, fine art galleries, shopping, and Museum Island. Although not walking distance, these sites were a short, and inexpensive, cab ride away. But how was the property itself? It was elegant, classy, and service-oriented. The rooms were spacious and well-appointed, with plenty of traveler conveniences such as waters, electrical outlets, nice toiletries, etc. The bathrooms were definitely on the small side, but they were efficient. The only critique I have is that foreigners are not used to the small 'individual\" comforters that are common in Germany. Each bed is allotted two, no sharing allowed! As for service, here again, the Adlon excelled. The staff was consistently helpful and, indeed, more welcoming and down-to-earth than the typical five-star experience. Overall, I would highly recommend the Adlon for anyone seeking a luxury experience in this historical city. Recommendations: *Some rooms face outside, some an inside courtyard, be sure to request your preference *Book tours of the Reichstag Dome in advance, through the concierge. You cannot just \"walk in\". *Concierge can also help with reserved entrance times at Museum Island, preventing a potential long wait. *Berlin's restaurants are very hit or miss. Recommendations include Pantry, Pauly Saal, Tim Raue *Hilke with \"Tours by Locals\" gives a great history tour! *If you take a cab from the airport, be sure to ask for \"The Adlon\" as there are two Kempinski hotels and locals refer to this one as The Adlon. *Sign up (free) for the Kempinski frequent guest program for additional benefits like free wi-fi",

There is no doubt that the buffet was comprehensive & beautifully presented but I have traveled all over the world in the last 40 years &, at 42 Euros per person, this must be the priciest hotel breakfast that I have ever encountered. In itself, I would not have much problem with this \u2013 hotels are entitled to charge whatever they think they can get away with - & I would simply just avoid eating breakfast in the hotel; however we were not made aware of the cost before we took the breakfast. Nowhere in the literature in our room or in the dining areas was the buffet advertised or a price shown for it & there was no alternative offered to the full buffet other than room service. It was not until I checked the room account on the TV that I was made aware of the cost. Hotel Adlon is completely open about other extras such as the bar, spa & laundry charges. Therefore, as they are so secretive about the buffet cost, I have to assume it is a deliberate policy to conceal it until after the guest has partaken of the service i.e. there is no informed consent sought or given for this charge. Unlike the other hotel services, we were not required to sign for the breakfast. It therefore seems to me to be a deliberate sneaky trick to extort money from their patrons under false pretences which I find despicable. I challenged my account before we departed but the front line staff refused to make any adjustment to my bill. I have since written to the General Manager with my views on this scam but have received no response. In conclusion, I would recommend staying here but for the sake of your pocket, eat your breakfast at another establishment. There are plenty of coffee houses etc in the area who will be delighted to serve you at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, as a consequence of their dishonorable policy on the breakfast buffet & in order to highlight this issue to other travelers, I can honestly award them only 1 star; otherwise it would have been 5.",

      "text": "I usually stay at Rocco Forte's \"Hotel de Rome\" when I come to Berlin. Since the Adlon has (from the catalogue) a slightly bigger Spa area and Berlin was experiencing heavy snow during my last trip I chose the Adlon for the first time due to the fact that I had much time and did want to spend some relax time by the pool and enjoy the Spa. When I arrived I had to wait a little lifetime to finally get checked in. Lines formed up at front desk since it was pretty busy. I booked a Superior Deluxe Room, that is supposed to have 42 sqm. or 451 sq.ft. Superior Deluxe is the highest room category and Adlon's web page says: \"Curtains undrawn. The view from your window is too great to be ignored. The morning sun caresses your skin.\" Firstly, the Superior Deluxe rooms face many directions. Consequently, they should skip the \"morning sun\" nonsense in their room description. Well: When I arrived, they tried to set me up with a room (660) that was frontally facing the \"Akademie der K\u00fcnste\" (Fine Arts Academy). Actually the hotel and the academy form somewhat like a courtyard. The academy is a new high tech glass building and does not really look nice but very technical. From the room they were showing me I could simply see many things that could be ignored (people sitting at their desks either studying or working). I could see nothing stunning as the web page announced. I said that I'm travelling for leasure and want to enjoy the trip, the room, the view (what I booked) etc. etc. Next, they tried to set me up with a room on the fifth floor (smoking floor). When we left the elevator the entire floor already smelled strongly like smoke. I told them NO. I booked a non-smoking room. Finally, I was set up with room 630, a room facing the street \"Unter den Linden\" (a busy shopping street), but that's it. You figure from the description of the web-page that you will be facing the \"Brandenburger Tor\" (The Gate) or some other great stuff. Only if I really leant out of my window I could see \"The Gate\" One girl from the front desk told me that none of the Superior Deluxe rooms is actually directly facing The Gate. I really question the room size, too. 42 sqm / 452 sq. ft is usually supposed to feel somewhat amply. But it doesn't at all. I had a tiny, tiny bath room with only one basin. The shower is so small, you can hardly turn around. In the toilet room you feel claustrophobic. Around the bed there is not much space. And the two chairs that were in my room were completely outdated and covered with some micro brin people had 15 years back. The room felt more like 25 sqm. They serve free 0,5 L water bottles in the sauna. The same amount of water is 9 Euros for 0.5 L in the mini bar. You have to be aware that the Spa and the pool area (pool, gym, sauna) are in two complete different sections of the hotel. All in the basement. The pool ambience is nice if you like Tuscany. In my opinion also very outdated. I had a lunch at the Quarre. Excellent, excellent food with very friendly but stiff service, though. Business lunch (16 Euros and only a main course), the dessert that i ordered was 13 Euros ;-). A 0,1 Litre of white wine is 10 Euros. A quick lunch for a single person is 49 Euros plus 10 Euros Tip. 59 Euros (around 85 Dollars). When I came back at night I had no urge to linger at the lobby or bar. The ordinary boring pioano jingle and touristy crowd. Pros: Very good location, very clean and well maintained, extremely friendly staff, excellent food, nice room set up (fruit, chocolates, wine), nice turn down service. Cons: Outdated interiour and outdated rooms that - in my opinion - don't match the hotel's own description. Tiny, tiny bathrooms, Spa and pool in seperate areas of the hotel. Ambience in the lobby like on the Titanic shortly before sinking. Extremely high additional charges. Wanna be happy, experience same service, excellent location and cool crowd? Stay at the Hotel de Rome. In the summer you can even enjoy a stunning roof top terrace that the Adlon does not have.",

      "text": "My husband and I both felt this is the best hotel we have stayed in... To put this into context.. We travel frequently probably once a month generally stay 90% of the time in 5 star hotels. This beats a hotel in Zambia where we had our own Butler, cape towns most exclusive property, countless Ritz Carlton and fairmount properties and 5 star hotels we have stayed at in Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa, Canada and the USA. I will try and summarise why we rate this hotel so high... 1) Cleaning and maintenance there were a few things that truly set this place aside from other hotels, it was spotlessly clean.. Absolutely spotless every inch of it. It takes a lot to keep a hotel of this size so clean. Our room was beautiful, big and beautiful furniture... Everything taken care of, great turndown service beautiful bathrooms and the other thing about this hotel was the d\u00e9cor was hardly a scratch on it anywhere, it is very well maintained. 2) The Spa very very good sometimes I go to spas at 5 star hotels and I'm disappointed with the maintenance which sometimes can be not so 5 star. This spa very different the staff are constantly going round cleaning it, there's a great jacuzzi very nice sanua and steam room and pool, no shortage of towels water or staff keeping the place spotless constantly looking after it. Again every inch of it felt well cared for, there was no grout missing no broken tiles everything looked brand new. Changing rooms again well maintained jacuzzi spacious and good temperature, ladies only and mixed sauna and steam room, nice looking gym and good range of spa treatments and they were reasonably priced for this standard of hotel. 3) The Hotel is in a great location for exploring the city. You are right near the Brandenburg Gate and there is plently of things to walk to, if you ever want to leave this oasis! The hotel has a huge amount of history and it was clear the staff felt privileged to be working there, just surpurb and wonderful to really be served by such wonderful people, all speaking a good range of languages, the front of house staff were well cultured and travelled. 4) The service my goodness the service.....was just surpurb all staff were excellent, helpful warm friendly the concierge in particular they were the best concierge I've seen anywhere, the moment we arrived our cases were taken from the car and everything was just organised. They were friendly helpful and warm not pretentious in any way, just lovely.The hotel made us feel very welcome we were celebrating a special wedding anniversary and received a lovely bottle of champagne. The hotel staff went the extra mile to anticipate our needs. All in all I simply cannot rate this hotel enough mainly because of the staff we feel they were just on another level compared with other 5 star hotels. This is the level of service you expect from a 5 star property this exceeded our expectations we stayed in a 5 star Fairmont property last week the service and staff not a patch on this place. The hotel is opulent, beautifully designed with a huge amount of history, there was building work but this did not bother us. A truly amazing stay with staff who know what they are doing who do everything they can to make you feel welcome. It was very clear to me this hotel is extra special because of the wonderful people who pride themselves on working there and put their hearts and souls into making sure the guests are exceptionally well looked after. I will be back next year when I hope to run the Berlin marathon I can't think of anywhere better to relax after running 42kms. This place is so special and the best place we have ever stayed anywhere in the world.",

      "text": "Now what to say about a german 5 star superior hotel. I'm staying around 100-150 nights a year in hotels and I expected much more. First thing, the room was not clean. For a 5-Star hotel I would expect a perfect clean room with no hairs of the previous person in the bed or dirty carpet and more than that perfect working bathroom equipment which was not the case. Second thing, the Internet connection (WLAN) in the room was bad. Low signal, poor performance and in times where Internet is going to be free with full speed it costs a lot of money here. Last but not least the charged me couple of hundred euros and no one knows why. After asking several times they were able to solve this and told me it was a system error. But of course it has good points as well: Breakfast - perfect, Service Staff - very helpful and friendly and location - amazing. So I would say the service was 4,5-5 Star but the hotel overall max. 4 stars compared to other hotels I'm in.",

      "text": "Just got back from a wonderful visit to Berlin. Stayed at the Adlon for two nights with a one night stay in Dresden before returning to the Adlon for the rest of the week. We had a room in the back part of the hotel the first two nights. Small, but lovely and complete with every detail of German functionality, including bedside controls for thermostat and lighting. Visited the spa, which was outstanding in its luxury and service. Wonderful classical Roman decor with a selection of herb waters and fruits. On our return from Dresden, we were upgraded to a room overlooking the courtyard. It was spectacular in every way. Fabulous upholstered headboard with luxurious bed linens. They even have a \"comfort menu\" where you can choose from a variety of pillows. Everything from hypo-allergenic to an anti-aging pillow coated with vitamin E! I could go on and on about the impeccable details. The Adlon is on par with the very finest hotels in the world in luxury and service and compared to prices in Paris, London and New York, it's a true bargain. I will mention that our two rooms had completely different mattresses. The first had a firm mattress, the second, a soft down pillow top cover. If mattress comfort is a priority, I would suggest requesting one that fits your needs. My only other suggestion relates to other travelers that have given the Adlon less than a 5 rating due to circumstances beyond the hotel's control. We were lucky enough to stay at the hotel at a time when there were no major business meetings there, but as we were leaving, we noticed that a large group was coming in and setting up a sign-in desk for their company right at the entrance. Very obtrusive and with hundreds of name-tagged guests roaming the lobby, it definitely took away from the elegant ambiance. If you are flexible, I would suggest booking at a time when there are no conventions at the hotel. Also, as far as the crowded lobby goes, the Adlon is on every tour guide list, so every tourist wants to get in. The staff does its best to limit the crowd, but it's obviously hard to please everyone. I noticed that someone on Trip Advisor who didn't even stay there gave the Adlon a 1 star because they weren't allowed in by the doorman when the lobby was crowded. Unbelievable. In closing, I would highly recommend the Adlon for its beauty, history, location and service. World class perfection!",

      "text": "We reserved 2 rooms in Adlon for a weekend . We are GHA Platinum and LHW members. During check in the lady informed us not to take an upgrade as the rooms we had are very good rooms with excellent views. It was true. We had view to the Brandenburgertor from our room. The first night we had problems with the shower. The temperature fluctuated from cold to extremely hot. I burned my back. I told the reception and they sent a technician to our room. He said he fixed it and we even received a letter. The next morning I was not able to take a shower as the problem was not solved. It was even worse. We called reception again and they fixed it the second day. The temperature was good, the shower fluctuated a little, but this did not bother us. The second day we had problems with wifi. We could not login. The operator connected us with Swisscom (why does a customer has to solve problems?). Swisscom did not answer and we could not make use of the wifi. We could make use of the business center but as we had to connect to our Iphone and Ipad we did not want to make use of the business center. The problem was solved hours later. In a welcomes letter is stated that we received complimentary Internet. The reception told us later that this is only free cable Internet and not free wifi Internet. I do not understand this at all. If you want to do this, inform the customers upfront instead of afterward. As a pre dinner drink we wanted to order Chardonnay in Quarre. Although they serve Chardonnay by the glass in the main lobby the restaurant does not want to sell Chardonnay by the glass in the restaurant. This is something I do not understand. I ordered a Cosmopolitan while the others ordered wine and beer. The wine and beer was brought to the table and I had to wait for 20 minutes for my Cosmo. I asked twice where the drink was. And it was on it's way. We ordered French fries with the dinner. They did not bring it immediately, so I asked immediately for the fries. The waiter apologized and said he would bring them. After 10-15 minutes when we were finished with our meal the waiter came with the fries. We sent them away as we were finished. Of course they were charged to the bill, but we asked them to be adjusted. And they did immediately. I guess you can reserve tables for breakfast. We saw 2 tables for 4 persons where we wanted to sit, but this was not possible as they were occupied. 1 table arrived 2 minutes after us and 1 table was not used the entire time we had breakfast. So next time I will reserve my table upfront. During check out some mistakes were made with the bill. For example Internet was charged although 3 persons informed us that they would adjust the Internet charge. This is a big mistake for these kind of hotels. What I really appreciated was that the Director Sales and Marketing came to me and appologized. He took good care of his guests. Accoring to LHW we receive a welcome gift, we did not get anything. According to our Platinum status we would get also a city experience. We did not get this neighter. I love the sauna and pool. Gym is not perfect. Too much cardio and almost no weights (dumbel of 10 KG was the most I could find). Love the bar, the lobby and the room. Service is good, but can be better. I heard too much \"My appologies\". Do give less apologies and do things good in the first way.",

      "text": "I was on a 5-cities-in-6-days business trip in Europe in late January 2010, with all the risks of January air travel in Europe. Arriving at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin on the afternoon of January 27, I certainly did not expect or need another hassle of body searches to get into the hotel. Nonetheless, that is what happened, and as a result, I will never stay at the Adlon again\u2014although I have enjoyed visits there in the past. When my cab approached the Adlon, we were stopped several blocks away and slowly moved, in snow, to a tent one and a half blocks away from the hotel. I was rudely ordered out of the cab by a guard with a weapon and escorted like a criminal into a tent, where I was ordered about in very rude language. I was then escorted by a guard, carrying my two bags myself for the block and a half into the Adlon lobby,. There, I was told to take off my clothing down to my shirt and trousers, and submitted to a body search. Once through the scanning machine, a very officious woman demanded my passport and drivers license and in very rude language told me to turn one of them in. She sent me to the opposite desk to do this, where I was given a security badge with the order to wear it at all times, in full sight, when in the hotel. I was told that if I needed to leave the hotel, I would need to go through the entire process again. After redressing and finally making it to the reception desk, I presented my American Express card for checkin. In response, the young man behind the counter, a hotel employee, snarled at me \u201cwhat do you want, what are you doing here?\u201d I explained that I was there, of course, to check in. I gave him my name again, and without looking me up in the computer, he snarled, \u201cwe have no record of your reservation.\u201d At this point, fortunately, a women desk person took over and immediately pulled up my reservation and checked me in. Next, two armed guards came up, carrying weapons, and proceeded to escort me to my room, which was located far away on the back side of the hotel, on the ground floor. Not a very desirable room, and not at all comparable to the room I had there last January. When I went out to a meeting the afternoon of Jan. 27, the guard desk was initially unable to locate my drivers license\u2014it had been misfiled, and I had to find it for them. Upon returning two hours later, I was taken to task for not having turned in my security badge when I left the hotel. I explained to the very officious official, who seemed to be a hotel employee, that I had no way of knowing what their procedures were, and it was their responsibility to have taken my badge\u2014and inappropriate for them to be shouting at me for still having the badge in my possession. That evening, when I went down to the Restaurant Quarre for dinner, I asked for a table with a view of the Brandenburg gate. This should not have been a problem, since the hotel and restaurant were very sparsely populated. But the woman at the restaurant reception desk said rudely to me, \u201cit will be impossible to give you a table with such a view.\u201d I pointed out that most tables in the restaurant were empty, and asked why not. Only then was I seated at a table with the requested view. During my entire meal, other tables with gate views remained unfilled. I understand that the reason for the elaborate and intense security was that a foreign chief of state was staying at the Adlon. This does not excuse the fact that guests were not alerted in advance that they would be put through such time-wasting treatment as a result of this official\u2019s presence, so that they would have known to go to another hotel. It was also inexcusable that hotel staff was not present at the security gates to assure that guests were treated respectfully. Most inexcusable was the unprovoked rudeness to paying ordinary guests by staff at the Hotel\u2019s own reception desk. I also wonder if the German prime minister does not have a guest house at which visiting heads of state can be lodged\u2014so that hotel guests are not relegated to nonperson status. As a result of this experience, I will never stay at the Adlon again, and would not recommend it to anyone. Ordinary business travels just do not matter to them.",
